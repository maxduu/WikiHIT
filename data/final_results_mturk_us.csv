Construct a suitable shelter as soon as you enter a new area to protect you from the cold, rain, and sun. Maintain this shelter by fixing any problems right away. Locate the shelter in a spot that's easy to hide in, just in case hostile people pass through the area. To make the job easier, try to build your shelter around an natural feature. A fallen tree, for example, could provide the support for a structure.","While almost everyone would like to avoid it, people unfortunately experience war every day. This is extremely stressful and dangerous, but you can deal with the situation if you maintain your focus and take the right steps. Gather and protect as many supplies as you can. Find reliable sources of food and water in the event of shortages. Avoid confrontation as much as you can, and move to a safer area if you have to. Finally, learn basic first aid skills to treat any injuries or illnesses you might encounter. Combined, these skills can keep you and your loved ones safe throughout survival situations.","If you like to spend time in the great outdoors, it may be helpful for you to know how to build a survival shelter. This kind of shelter helps protect people who are stranded in the wilderness from the elements until they can be rescued. Fortunately, whether you’re in the woods, in snow, or even in a desert, building a survival shelter out of natural materials is a relatively straightforward process.","Polishing your automobile will help to extend the life and beauty of the paint and exterior. Polishing is the oft forgotten step between washing and waxing, but when done properly, it completely revitalizes the car's exterior finish.  A thorough car polishing will remove firmly bonded surface contaminants and subsurface paint defects, and will prepare the surface gloss for wax application. Successfully polishing your car may require a polishing wheel – but it is possible to complete the polishing by hand.","Camping can be a lot of fun and a great way to enjoy nature.  Many people enjoy using a tent for the ease at which they can be set up.  However, tents can be heavy and bulky to carry with you on a camping trip.  To make your camping trip less difficult, you may want to use a tarp shelter.  Tarps are lightweight and fairly easy to build a shelter with, helping to make your camping trip a comfortable one.","Did you know dogs could get hypothermia and frostbite in extreme weather? If your dog stays outside for long periods, then they need proper shelter.","If you like to spend time in the great outdoors, it may be helpful for you to know how to build a survival shelter. This kind of shelter helps protect people who are stranded in the wilderness from the elements until they can be rescued. Fortunately, whether you’re in the woods, in snow, or even in a desert, building a survival shelter out of natural materials is a relatively straightforward process.","If you’re looking for a secluded place to play, rest or hang out with your friends, a private hideout may be just what you need. When you’re building a hideout, you can let your imagination take over. Once you’ve got it set up, named and filled with a few of your things, your hideout will be like a home away from home—or within it!","If you’re lost or staying out in the jungle, a shelter is important if you want to stay dry and safe from the elements. Even if you don’t have any tools, you can work with the natural resources around you to make a sturdy place to sleep. Once you find the right location, you can make a number of different shelters in a short amount of time!","","Building a bomb shelter is different from the construction of storm shelters, fall out shelters, and other structures in that it is built in anticipation of direct exposure to explosive ordinance. This project requires special materials and construction practices, and is not for a novice or hobbyist. Nevertheless, here are steps to help you learn how to accomplish this task.","A storm shelter is a safe place that you can use to take refuge during a catastrophic storm event such as a tornado or a hurricane. Building an in-ground or above-ground storm shelter should be done by licensed professionals who follow the guidelines set by governmental organizations such as the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). But, you can build your own storm shelter on top of your concrete slab foundation that you can use to protect yourself during a storm. Start by choosing a location on top of the concrete slab of the structure and measuring how much space you’ll need. Then, build a sturdy frame to support the shelter. Finally, cover the walls with steel sheeting and plywood and install a door that is certified to withstand the pressure, wind, and impact of catastrophic storms.","You are lost in the woods, the sky is starting to look cloudy, and it's getting cold. It might be a good idea to build something you can stay warm in for a night. You need a shelter. Here are a few tips to help.","Camouflage is the art of not been seen, with passers by being unaware of your presence.

Sometimes the act alone of journal ling is enough to keep you sane and accountable to yourself. Use a pen and notebook, journaling app or online site to start your journal. You don't have to journal everyday, but it might help you get all you thoughts out on paper. You can also use your journal to keep track of your weight progress or food journal throughout your Atkin's diet.","","In order to start a journal, you'll need a notebook, a writing tool, and a commitment to yourself. The first move is to write your first entry. Then, you can think about keeping up a regular journal! Use the journal as a way to explore your innermost thoughts and feelings – the things that you cannot tell anyone else.","Regular hydration is a vital component of maintaining good health, but many people struggle to drink enough water daily.  Cucumber water is a delicious solution to this problem, adding flavor without the calories of juices, sodas and other beverages.  You can make cucumber water at home so you always have something tasty to stay hydrated, or you can serve it to guests and impress as a host.","Journaling is one of the most rewarding and therapeutic writing exercises you can engage in. Not only can your journal act as an outlet for your daily frustrations, it can also serve as a place for you to articulate your hopes and dreams. However, you might sometimes find it difficult to start a journal entry. Thankfully, by deciding what to write about, figuring out how to frame your entry, and determining when to write, you'll have a much easier time starting journal entries.","Whether you normally have a hard time remembering your dreams or just want to be able to look back at this point in your life, tracking your dreams in a diary is the best answer. A dream diary is simple to begin, fun to build and intriguing as a source of insight, (See guidance on interpreting dreams, below.) You may be wondering, ""How do I make a dream diary?"" Well, read on and soon your diary will be ready!","Keeping a personal diary can help you work out your feelings, keep track of the good things in your life, and just get you to write more. Buying diary supplies that you like and will use, setting a writing schedule that helps you commit to writing every day, and deciding what to write can all help you get started on a new diary.","Journal writing is a creative form of recording your feelings free from the fear of judgement or criticism. Writing in a journal can allow you to work through complex issues in your life, exploring them thoroughly and candidly. It can also be a way of relieving stress, rather than inadvertently taking out your unexplored feelings on someone else. See Step 1 below to start writing your own journal.","Are you stressed out? Just need to let everything out of your system! Then a secret diary is perfect for you! Read on!","Keeping a journal is a great way to process your thoughts and emotions. Additionally, it helps you remember your life experiences. If you’re ready to start journaling, decide on what type of journal you want to keep. Then, express your thoughts, experiences, and ideas in your journal entries. To keep up your journaling habit, challenge yourself to write every day.","Diaries are a great way to record your daily life, thoughts, and feelings.

Many financial professionals advise that you save an equivalent of six months of your after-tax wages in this account. However, an amount of $3,000, or in some cases as little as $500, can be enormously helpful in dealing with unexpected expenses and avoiding financial disaster.","Financial trouble can strike suddenly and can come from a variety of sources. Perhaps you lose your job, suddenly find yourself in credit card debt, or lose it all on an investment gone wrong. In any case, the most important thing you can do is stop and think to identify the problem and plan a way out of it. By doing so, you can immediately get started on the path towards regaining your financial security.","","","Becoming the manager of your own hedge fund will give you the opportunity to invest other people's money for them, which can be profitable for you and your investors. If you're an experienced financial advisor, it may be advantageous for you to step out from under the umbrella of the investment banking industry and strike your own path. To start a hedge fund, you'll need to create and register a fund and start an investment company to be the fund's general partner. In this endeavor, the investors will act as limited partners in a private partnership.","","A “giving fund” is a name used to describe a way of setting money aside that you can use to help others in need. You can create a very simple, yet still effective, giving fund on a personal level by regularly setting aside money and using it to make donations. On a slightly larger scale, you can organize a group of friends or coworkers to establish a group fund. At the peak, you might want to create a public organization to solicit contributions and make charitable donations. These all operate in basically the same way, although the more public giving funds begin to require some consideration for tax consequences.","Raising money for your favorite charity sounds like a great idea. It can be a lot of fun to hold events for charities, but it can also be a lot of work, too. Nonetheless, you can use a variety of ways to raise money, keeping both you and your charity happy.","","A family fun fund is a savings fund to spend on anything the family wants. The idea is to contribute to it over a year and to spend it at the end of the year on something that the family wants as a whole.","All businesses rely on a source for funding everyday expenses, from office supplies to inventory. Borrowing money to pay for a business comes with many risks, even if you decide to use your own funds. If you are looking to fund a business, consider the following list of suggestions when making your decision.","","There's no question that charities, nonprofits, PTAs, clubs and many other groups need to raise funds.  The question is, how to do it effectively.  This article introduces several ways that your group can raise funds for its projects.","Although the idea of a trust fund is generally associated with estate planning for the very wealthy, middle class families can also benefit from the tax advantages and privacy of a trust fund. The idea that you have to be rich to utilize a trust fund is a fallacy.  Trust funds allow people to distribute their property and assets to beneficiaries without having to involve the courts in the probate process and without having to pay some estate taxes.  You can set up a trust fund with the assistance of a trust and estates attorney, or you can draw up the documents yourself.","3","0","4","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

Only by paying down student loans, car loans, and other debt can you qualify for more credit as a couple and move forward with saving for other goals. To eliminate debt, work together to pay more than the minimum payment on each loan (as long as there are no prepayment penalties for doing so). Work with your spouse to create a plan and schedule for paying off your outstanding debt. If necessary, have one of you in charge of making sure that debt payments have been made each month.","To live a happy and peaceful life with financial freedom, it's very important to manage family finances properly. Failing to manage spending or agree on financial decisions can cause a married couple to fall into endless arguing. To get through the many financial decisions present in married life, you have to coordinate a budget and financial planning with the whole family and keep an open dialogue going about the family's money.","","Whether you're trying to learn martial arts for self-defense purposes, for personal development, or simply to imitate Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, you'll want to eventually learn the roundhouse kick (also known by its traditional name, the mawashi geri). Though martial arts experts can make it look effortless, it can actually take some serious practice to perfect the move, especially if you plan on using specialized kick techniques. Be patient and devote plenty of time to your practice and soon you'll be delivering high-flying kicks like a karate master.","Your debt-to-income ratio is a number that reflects how much you need to pay each month toward your debt versus what you bring in each month. You can calculate your debt-to-income ratio by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. This score (which is expressed as a percentage) is largely used to determine whether or not you will be approved for a mortgage. You can lower this number in 2 broad ways: you can lower your debt or increase your salary. Lowering your debt-to-income ratio will happen more effectively if you can do both.","No one sets out to get into debt yet all too soon in life the day rolls around when you can't progress any further with your life plan without arranging a mortgage, loan, credit card or overdraft. Borrowing can work for you, what you need to avoid is working to pay off your borrowing, with no money spare for anything else. Reducing personal debt can free up some of your cash so you can buy more of what you want, save up for a big purchase, plan for your future, or just have some cash spare for that virtually inevitable rainy day.","","Few things are as stressful as falling behind on your debt. As you miss payments, your creditors increase the interest or tack on penalties and late fees. Soon, you’re in a hole you can’t get out of. In this situation, your only option may be debt settlement. Generally, debt settlement involves offering your creditors a lump sum of money in exchange for them writing off the remainder of your debt. Unfortunately, your creditors do not have to agree to debt settlement, so consider all your options.","If you are having trouble keeping up with your debt payments, there are steps you can take. By finding ways to lower your interest rate, consolidating your debts, and reducing your balance overall you can lower the amount you pay each month. You might also opt to work with a credit counselor. Ultimately, the best way to lower your payments is to slowly-but-surely get out of debt. Hopefully, by obtaining lower monthly payments, this can happen more easily.","","If you find yourself skipping credit card monthly payments, ignoring mail because you don’t want the bad news, or using one credit card to pay off another, these are all signs that you may be getting into serious financial trouble. Before the problem becomes so bad that you have no options, you should examine your finances closely and consider settling some of your debts. A settlement comes as the result of negotiating with creditors to allow a payment of less than the full amount that you owe. This will still have a negative effect on your credit score, but it is not nearly as bad as getting sued or going into bankruptcy. If you handle the matter correctly, you can take back control of your financial affairs through negotiation and settlement.","","There are many reasons why you might want to reduce bust size. Large breasts can cause some serious issues over time, including back pain, poor posture, and troubles with breathing. Additionally, larger breasts have a tendency to sag more noticeably later in life. If you are struggling with large breasts and want to make a change, get started with Step 1 below to learn how to reduce your bust line.","Using a balance transfer might be a good way to reduce your debt. Some credit card companies offer a low or 0% introductory APR for a limited amount of time, which will allow you to contribute more to paying down your debt. Find a credit card to transfer your balance to and then identify which debts you want to transfer. Remember to use all money available to pay down your debt as soon as possible.

This is because, due to the effects of compound interest, money placed in a retirement fund at a young age will earn much more interest over its life than the same amount of money put in at a later age. Make sure to make every effort to increase your retirement savings, including seeking to max out your employer's 401(k) match (if they have one), maxing out IRS-limits for 401(k) savings, and regularly increasing your retirement savings amounts if you can fit it into the budget. You should save for retirement before putting money into education funds for your children. This is because there will always be scholarships and grants available for education, but not for your retirement. If you don't have a combined retirement portfolio, be sure to coordinate your risk profiles and asset allocations.","To live a happy and peaceful life with financial freedom, it's very important to manage family finances properly. Failing to manage spending or agree on financial decisions can cause a married couple to fall into endless arguing. To get through the many financial decisions present in married life, you have to coordinate a budget and financial planning with the whole family and keep an open dialogue going about the family's money.","Unfortunately, retiring is getting harder and harder, with more expensive medical insurance and the possibility that social security will not exist or be severely watered-down.  Many hard working people are forced to save as much as possible for the golden years to sidestep the possible hardship they may face.  Whether you are 50 or 22, the best thing you can do is to start planning as early as possible for your retirement.","There are five important commands that every dog should know: sit, stay, lay down, come, and heel. These commands will help you communicate your wishes to your dog, essentially giving you a line of clear communication with your pet. If you give your dog a good training in the basic commands, you set the groundwork for future advanced training, as well as simply aiding in a conflict free relationship with your furry best friend.","","","","Retirement can be a happy time of life, but also comes with stress. When first entering retirement, it can be difficult to manage your expectations. So much free time can be overwhelming. However, there are many ways you can make the most out of your retired years. You can start by making a plan. Think about your budget, and how you would like to spend your time. From there, work on keeping busy. Join a local club or take up a new hobby. Make sure to keep social relationships strong during retirement. Retirement is a great time to get in touch with old friends and strengthen family bonds.","It’s tough being a single parent, and financial difficulties are some of the hardest to overcome. However, even single parents need to save for their retirement.  To begin, save as much money as possible after paying for necessities. Create a budget and cut your discretionary spending. Once you’ve freed up money, you can open a retirement account, either at work or on your own.","","Retirement planning is not something most people look forward to, but it is a necessary fact of life. If you don't want to work during your retirement years, you need to ensure that you have enough retirement savings to last, and that takes careful planning. By determining how you will need to save for retirement, you'll be able to set your goals and not worry about the future.","Retirement is a major life change. So much of your sense of self worth is tied up with career success and accomplishment. When you retire, you suddenly have to adjust to a vastly different schedule. Prepare yourself emotionally for the adjustment, accepting that you'll be sad for a little bit after retiring. Then, make some plans to keep yourself busy. This will help you with the adjustment phase. Lastly, take care of yourself. Make an effort to eat right and exercise regularly, as this can help with your emotional well-being.","","Your retirement account provides a nest egg for the later years of your life. As this investment continues to grow, it is important to understand how to withdraw retirement funds once the time is right and the need arises. Because there are very specific rules governing IRA distributions, some research is important so that you make your retirement withdrawal according to those rules. You need to know when you can begin taking money from your account and the best way to manage your withdrawals to maximize the tax benefits. As with any financial decisions, you should consult with an accountant or other tax professional for assistance.","4","3","0","4","0","4","3","3","4","3","2","3"

Learn to cope with unbearable people by making sure to set aside time for yourself. Consider these activities: Exercise. Go for a walk or run. Get outdoors. Take a hike. Ride a bike. Go to the gym. Go for a swim. Do something creative. Write in a journal. Play music. Draw. Build something. Be with friends and your community. Find group activities that interest you. Meditate. Do stretches. Practice yoga.","Sometimes family members can be difficult or downright unbearable at times.  No family is immune to having challenges.  Learning to deal with your parents, siblings, cousins, in-laws, uncles, and all those other relatives can be hard.  By setting boundaries, you'll feel more in control.  Staying calm and reducing your stress will also help you feel less anxious.  Protect yourself from negative family members.  Accept what you can, and let go of what you can't.","Life can be stressful; sometimes you'll have to deal with ongoing stress positively. Stress can have a variety of causes such as family problems, job problems, financial difficulties, poor health, or even the death of someone close to you. It is important to recognize the causes (some stress is natural), take steps to deal with the root of the problem, and tackle the symptoms.  Most importantly, don't battle stress alone — ask for help from a friend and, if necessary, a professional.","","Dealing with school stress is something most students have to learn to do during the course of their education. Feeling overwhelmed, out of control, unsure of what you're supposed to be doing or how you're supposed to do it can all result in feeling stressed. To deal with school stress, try to apply new organizational skills. Prioritize what you pay attention to, and develop habits of healthy living that will minimize your stress.","","Exams are a crucial part of education and the source of stress for many students. In order to avoid crippling anxiety from these pesky evaluations, it is important to approach them with a clear mind and an understanding of how to deal with stressful situations more broadly. In many cases, exam stress is all in the mind, and mental discipline is a large part of what is needed to succeed.","For many people, stress is a constant part of their lives. Stress not only increases anxiety, but it wears people down and undermines their ability to be productive. However, while most people view stress as a bad thing, it does not have to be this way. There are many ways to train yourself so that you can turn bad stress into good, productive, stress. After identifying stressors, you can learn to use them as  motivators. From there, you can work toward personal growth.","Life can be stressful; sometimes you'll have to deal with ongoing stress positively.

However, with a little preparation and perspective, you can make the relocation process a little easier for you and your family. In order to make moving less stressful, it’s important to stay organized before you move, take care of yourself during this stressful time, and adapt to your new residence. Coping with the stress of moving can be difficult, but moving can be an exciting and fun new chapter to your life.","The school year can be hard on anyone. Academic stress can build upon self-esteem issues, your family, friends and even yourself. When not taken care of, your performance suffers, your morale suffers, and life just suffers. Instead of being on the brink of a constant freak out, grab life by the horns and get to relaxing. It may be easier than you think.","Do you ever get really stressed out? Well, here are a few ways to deal with stress and make it go away the easiest way.","Every relationship has rough spots. When that time comes, there's no need to freak out. Every relationship has its ups and downs: stress is just as natural a part of it as are more enjoyable moments. We all go through hard times at work or with our friends or family.

Remember, your needs are just as important as the needs of others. Work on being more assertive and you'll start to feel more confident. For example, maybe your older sister makes you feel insecure with her frequent put downs. The next time she says, “Don't let Linda be in charge of dinner. She's a horrible cook!”, speak up. You can say, “I'd love to host Thanksgiving this year. I've been working really hard to become a better cook, and I think I'm getting good!”","Insecurity is an uncertainty or of lack confidence in oneself.  Most people have dealt with insecurity at one time or another. The feeling, while uncomfortable, is completely normal and very common. For some, these feelings pass and do little to no harm; for others, insecurity can become overpowering and have a serious impact on their lives. It can prevent a person from truly being themselves and keep them from doing the things they enjoy. If you find yourself regularly fighting insecurity, it might be time to make some changes. Work to shift your mindset, become more confident, and focus on the good relationships in your life.","Being assertive falls right in the middle of being passive and being aggressive. If you're passive, you'll never get to vocalize your needs; if you're aggressive, you'll look like a big bully and will likely be misdirecting your frustrations. But if you're assertive, you'll be able to express your desires while respecting the needs of others, and you'll have a better chance of getting what you want and deserve.","Writing a summary is a great way to process the information you read, whether it’s an article or a book. If you’re assigned a summary in school, the best way to approach it is by reviewing the piece you’re summarizing. Read it thoroughly and take notes on the major points you want to  include in your summary. When you get to writing your summary, rely on your memory first to make sure the summary is in your own words. Then, revise it to ensure that your writing is clear and the grammar, punctuation, and spelling are all perfect.","Assertiveness is a particular way of communicating with others that is direct and honest, but also respectful. An assertive communicator knows what they think or what they want, and they are not afraid to ask for it directly. They don’t get angry or let their emotions dominate them, though. Learning assertive communication takes time, but if you practice expressing your needs and expectations, relying on facts instead of blame, and showing respect to others when they speak, you can eventually master this powerful form of communication.","","","Being assertive is a constructive way for dealing with difficult people, achieving your goals, and solving a problem. Whether it’s with a co-worker or a friend, communicating confidently and in a straightforward manner can help you get what you need. Being assertive differs from being aggressive as assertiveness involves a constructive and polite attitude. Aggressive behavior involves speaking before you think, insulting people, and not listening to what others need. Be assertive and not aggressive to solve your problems by decompressing from a stressful situation, communicating properly, and understanding others’ point of view.","Being assertive falls right in the middle of being passive and being aggressive. If you're passive, you'll never get to vocalize your needs; if you're aggressive, you'll look like a big bully and will likely be misdirecting your frustrations. But if you're assertive, you'll be able to express your desires while respecting the needs of others, and you'll have a better chance of getting what you want and deserve.","Anger management, self-help, and confidence-building literature always explains the importance of being assertive in your daily interactions rather than resorting to being aggressive. Recognising which approach you're using can sometimes be difficult if you're in the thick of trying to sort out your personal development and interpersonal relations. Yet, it's important to know when you've finally embraced an assertive approach and laid the angry self to one side.","You may think that having self-confidence is like having blue eyes. Either you're born with it or you're not. Well, if you have that kind of mindset and you lack self-confidence, then you're bound to accept failure. It's time to shed the idea that not just anyone can develop confidence and to work on changing your mindset, as well as your actions, to be on the way to developing the faith and trust in yourself that you have been lacking. If you want to know how to be more self-confident, see Step 1 to get started.","Being assertive in your relationships can be difficult, but it isn’t impossible. You may be having trouble in multiple different types of relationships, including those with your partner, friends, or coworkers. By determining your own beliefs and opinions, accepting the validity of these opinions, and becoming more active in expressing these beliefs and opinions, you can become more assertive in all types of relationships.","","Being assertive is important to professional and personal success. You need to be able to assert your needs and wants to help you grow in your career and maintain personal relationships; however, many women feel uncomfortable being assertive. Dominant women are often looked down on in the media, so you may feel being assertive is not your place. Work on changing that mindset. Accept that you have needs and wants that are as valid as the needs and wants of those around you. Learn to adopt assertive body language and articulate yourself clearly. If you're stuck in any non-assertive patterns, work on altering these behaviors.","2","2","3","2","3","3","3","3","4","2","3","3"

To effectively fulfill this role, you need to be certain of your own spiritual convictions. Make sure you are spending time with God, reading the Bible, attending church, and developing your beliefs. When you are in a good place spiritually, you will be able to effectively help your godchild as well. If you are struggling with your beliefs, you could try joining a small group or finding a mentor. This could help you to work through some of your doubts and learn from others. A daily devotional is also a useful tool in nurturing your faith. Choose one that will help you draw near to God and provide encouragement.","Being a godparent is both an honor and a responsibility. It entails a lifelong commitment to a child and is a special role to play in that child’s life. This requires giving time, love, and spiritual advice to both the child and their family. When done well, it can be incredibly rewarding for everyone involved.","","This wikiHow teaches you how to create and begin using a blog, both in general and by using specific platforms such as WordPress and Blogger.","Scripture explains that Christians must ""walk by faith, not by sight"" (2 Corinthians 5:7). It can be difficult to know what a walk of faith requires, though.","Many people slowly drift apart from their faith and religion. Soon they start to lose their personal contact with God. If you desire, there is a way to slowly come back to your faith. Read on, and be nourished by the word of God.","","Beliefs are the principles that drive your actions in life and help you make sense of the world around you. For the most part, your early beliefs were influenced by the people around you, namely your parents. However, as you grew older, your experiences as well as those of friends, teachers, and even TV personalities began to influence your belief system. If you want to develop your own beliefs, you must first become aware of your pre-existing beliefs and decide if they are helpful. Then, explore different belief systems in order to form your own.","How do you introduce others to your faith? There are billions of people in the world today, and you want to reach each one of them with the truth. Here are some steps and tips to help you witness to others:","","","","","We are all born receptive to love, kindness and hope. As we grow up, we encounter the less hopeful, more challenging aspects of being human, including noticing world issues such as poverty and discrimination, and discovering that the things humans do at times can be hateful, calculating and unkind.

You can acknowledge these things with a compliment. Just make sure that your compliments are genuine. People can tell when compliments are not sincere. Think of something like: I've read that book. Great choice! I love those shoes. They go great with that skirt. Is that a hazelnut latte? Nice -- that's my go-to every Monday morning.","Some people are naturally outgoing, but other people have to practice to become outgoing. If you want to become outgoing, there are several strategies that you can use. Being “outgoing” involves learning how to present yourself to others, striking up conversations, and being more confident in yourself.","It feels good to receive a compliment. Compliments bring positive feelings that come because someone has noticed something about you they deemed worthy of praise. Compliments are important components of sociability and are also useful devices for beginning conversations. For some, giving compliments is an uncomfortable venture because of uncertainties. If you can relate to this anxiety, start at Step 1 to learn how to suitably give compliments.","Maybe your current job just isn’t working out, or maybe you just graduated and are trying to get employed for the first time. The job market can be hard to crack in either case, no matter your age or experience. Start by networking and searching online for job openings, tailoring your resume and cover letter to match what employers are seeking, and then sending in stand-out applications. The process may seem daunting, but going in with determination and a plan will carry you through until you find the perfect opportunity.","“Lisa, congrats on your wedding! It was beautiful! Maybe now we can actually focus on work during office hours rather than gushing about wedding planning details, eh?” Many of us have been on the receiving end of a seemingly well-intended compliment—seemingly being the operative term because, in truth, the person was merely sugarcoating a below-the-belt jab. Learn how to deal with insincere compliments by responding appropriately, managing future interactions with the person, and distinguishing veiled offenses from truly genuine compliments.","","Giving is extremely rewarding, and most of us really want to lend a helping hand.

Just be sure you give the right compliment in the right way, so you don't send the wrong message.","Knowing how to give a good compliment is one of the most important social skills you need to thrive in our society.

You've earned somebody's respect and admiration. What do you say to that? If you're flustered by praise, it's time to learn how to take a compliment at face value and appreciate the sentiment.

With minimal preparation and the correct diamond tile bit for your Dremel tool, you’ll be cutting tile in no time.","A Dremel tool has a rotating head with interchangeable bits that you can use to cut and carve a variety of materials. If you want to carve designs or letters into a piece of wood, a Dremel tool will easily cut through the material and make intricate lines. Start by choosing a design and transferring it to the piece of wood you’re working on. Use the various bits that come with your tool to carve out your designs until you’re happy with how they look. When you’re done carving, sand any rough edges and add some finishing touches to make your design really pop!","","Changing the bit on a Dremel tool is similar to changing the bit on other rotary tools, like electric drills. You just need to know how to release and loosen the chuck nut properly, so you can swap out the bit, and then tighten it back up again. Sometimes, you will need to swap out the part that holds the bit, called the collet, so that you can put larger or smaller bits in your Dremel. Once you know how, it only takes a few minutes to adapt your Dremel tool to all your rotary tool projects!","One of the most common issues that people may encounter when using Beats by Dre headphones are its loose hinges.

Dreidel pops are made by sticking a Hershey’s kiss to the bottom of a marshmallow, then piercing the top of the marshmallow with a pretzel stick to give it the shape of a spinning top. After making the basic form of the dreidel pops, you can decorate them by coating them in blue candy melts, then adding on the Hebrew letters so that they look like real dreidels! Because marshmallow dreidel pops require minimal cooking and are easy to assemble, they are the perfect activity to do with a child to teach them more about Chanukah and the game of dreidel!","A paper dreidel garland can be a fun, easy decoration for Hanukkah. You may hang the garland on your mantle at home or over a doorway at your local Jewish community center. To make the paper dreidel garland, you will need to gather the necessary supplies and spend some time putting the dreidel pieces together to create the garland.

It can also aggravate skin conditions such as rosacea and eczema. In terms of your body's chemistry, stress causes an increase in the hormone cortisol, which triggers oil production and leads to acne fare-ups. It also causes blood vessels to dilate which causes redness. On a physical level, constantly furrowing your brow and frowning causes a loss of collagen and can lead to premature wrinkles. Therefore, by reducing your stress levels, you can improve the quality of your skin. You can do this by making time for yourself and doing things you enjoy, like going for a walk, taking a yoga class, or just spending time with your loved ones.","Everyone has had to deal with one skin issue or another at some point in their lives, whether it's acne, dryness, sensitivity, oiliness, discoloration or wrinkles. While it’s impossible to avoid or eliminate most of these issues entirely, you can take steps to minimize and manage them. Achieve the healthiest possible skin by developing a good skincare routine. You can also troubleshoot specific skin problems as they arise with the right products or medications. Finally, take care of your skin and your entire body by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.","","Before you bake something, your oven needs to be heated to the proper temperature. While it takes only a few seconds to turn on your oven, it can take several minutes for it to reach the right temperature.

Because of how long it takes for an oven to warm up, most recipes will recommend that you turn your oven on first, before starting to cook. This article will show you how to preheat both an electrical oven and a gas oven.","Car driving is an unusual activity as far as our bodies are concerned.

If you are in charge of preparing the holiday season activities, or if you simply become overwhelmed with all of the festivities and interpersonal expectations, the pressure can soon mount up. If the holidays have you tied up in knots, toss the guilt for not keeping up with everything and start taking care of yourself in order to manage stress and find ways to enjoy the holiday break.","Heat stress is a condition that can occur when one is exposed to extreme heat. There are several levels of heat stress, ranging from a largely harmless sunburn or heat rash to serious heat stroke. Though the worst cases can lead to severe dehydration, organ damage, disability, and even death, the condition can be prevented by taking some basic precautions and vigilantly checking for possible symptoms.","Students of all kinds are often faced with what can seem like an overwhelming amount of homework.  Although homework can be a source of stress, completing it can be a very rewarding and even relaxing experience if done in an organized and timely manner. Remember, homework is not intended as punishment, but is used to reinforce everything you’ve learned in class. Try to view it as a chance to sharpen your skills and understanding.","When you're experiencing a negative emotion like stress, you may reach for food as a form of comfort or distraction. While this may work in the short term, it is just as likely to make you feel more stressed. Stress eating can cause you to gain unwanted weight, spend more than you want, and lose track of the things that make you feel good. Luckily, there are many ways to break this habit. Start by paying more attention to your stress levels and to your eating habits. If you're still struggling, or if you suspect you have an eating disorder, get help from a professional.","Although your eyes are designed to be used 24 hours a day, focusing on small items for a prolonged period of time, perhaps while reading or working on the computer, commonly causes eye strain. If you have a job where you have to do this, you may suffer from eye strain. There are things you can do to help avoid and treat eye strain.","Stress is a normal part of life. Even good things, like family and friends, can cause us stress. If the stress load in your life is becoming too much, you can work on ways to reduce stress. While stress can never entirely be eliminated, certain actions can help you be a calmer, more carefree person. First, work on managing day-to-day stress. Coping in the moment is key to stress management. Change the social dynamics in your life. Make time for people who are fun and relaxing, while setting boundaries with those who are not. Make some basic lifestyle changes as well. Simply changing your diet and getting more sleep can reduce stress.","","Secondhand stress, just like the name implies, is when you start absorbing the feelings of stressed individuals around you. These could be coworkers, bosses, friends, or family members. In these situations, you can't make the other person stop feeling stressed, so you'll have to work on yourself to make sure you don't soak up that stress and treat it like your own.","3","3","0","2","3","4","3","3","3","2","3","4"

Culture shock is defined as the feeling of disorientation, insecurity, and anxiety one may feel in unfamiliar surroundings. Values, behaviors, and social customs we routinely take for granted may no longer serve us in our new environment. By adapting to a foreign culture, you can overcome your culture shock and develop meaningful relationships with those around you, rather than feeling anxious and confused in your new space.","If you want to become open to different ideas, beliefs, and backgrounds, you're in luck!

Open-minded people live exciting, balanced, and inquisitive lives, and you can be one of them after a little hard work.","Being an ""open person"" can mean many different things, all of them positive. It's a term with no set definition, but it generally includes some combination of friendliness, approachability, honesty, open-mindedness, tolerance, and personal authenticity. Open people tend to be more happy, charismatic, likable, and successful compared to people who are ""closed off.""

If you need to open up a screw back watch for any reason, you’ll be pleased to know that it’s a simple, straightforward procedure—all you need is a watch case wrench and a watch case holder.

As the parent to your son or daughter, recognize that the first steps to repair the relationship fall on you to try to initiate contact, whether or not you believe you did anything wrong to cause the estrangement. Honor the boundaries your adult child has set with regards to your relationship and do not push back against them, but set your own boundaries as well. Learn to accept your adult child for who they are, and acknowledge their independence and ability to make their own choices.","While apologizing in person often conveys more sincerity, there are times when a formal, written apology might be your only option or could otherwise be the preferred method. To write an apology letter, you'll need to address your error early in the letter, acknowledge the other party's hurt feelings, and accept full responsibility for your part in the matter. In many cases, you'll also need to offer a solution that will fix any underlying issues related to the original problem. If you want to make sure that your apology is effective and doesn't cause even more hurt, aim for both clarity and sincerity while you write.","Cover letters.

Hope is associated with thinking things will turn out okay and hoping for the best (not expecting the worst to happen). Focus on what you hope to happen in the future. Believe that things will work out okay, or the way they are supposed to, even if they aren't exactly the way you planned them. One way to increase hope is to catch your negative thoughts such as, ""Nothing will ever change. I can't fix this."" These are very hopeless thoughts that may lead to depressed mood. If you notice these types of thoughts you can immediately say to yourself, ""That is a hopeless thought. I am hopeful. I may not be able to completely fix this issue, but I might be able to change something about this situation. I can at least change how I think about it."" Focus on changing your thoughts like this and you can become more hopeful overall.","","Do you often find yourself struggling to see any meaning or purpose in your day-to-day activities? Do you want to break out of bad habits but can’t find the desire to do so?

Follow these steps below to get on your way to seeing more possibilities in your everyday life circumstances.","","Whatever your goals are, always remember you can make it true.

Seeking forgiveness is the step that has to follow confession. Once God has forgiven you, the lines of communication will be much more open between you and God. There is not a specific prayer of forgiveness you must pray. Tell God that you are sorry and that you want Him to forgive you for wronging Him. Pray, “God, I’m sorry for lying about what I did last night. I should not have done that. Please forgive me for my dishonesty.”","You have something you want to ask God for, but you don’t know how to go about asking. God hears your prayers, but he doesn't always give you exactly what you ask for. It’s important to praise God and seek forgiveness for sins before you ask Him to give you what you want. Ask God to work the way He wants. Also, be honest and specific when you ask Him for what you want. Be patient and believe that God will act.","Asking God to forgive your sins is an important process. It is important that you admit what you did wrong and truly feel sorry that you did it. You must come to God, pray using scripture, and ask Him to forgive you. Then you must believe that he has.

If done thoughtfully and effectively, it will transform the way you think, feel, and live your life. Approaching the challenge with an “I can do that” attitude will motivate you to face the challenge. By taking action, changing your thoughts, shifting your emotions and seeking guidance from numerous valuable sources you will know how to forgive others, and yourself.","The relationship you have with God is, in and of itself, already pleasing in God's sight. Focus on beliefs and behaviors that strengthen the relationship you have with Him if you want to deepen God's pleasure even more.","Asking God to forgive your sins is an important process.

Keep the following in mind: If the wall or ceiling is new, unpainted plaster or drywall, make sure the surface is as smooth as possible. If there are dents, nail holes, or other blemishes in an older wall or ceiling, patch them with spackle, sand them smooth, and prime them before proceeding. Clean older walls or ceilings with an appropriate cleanser based on the paint finish, then let them dry fully before applying a knockdown texture. Although people typically paint or repaint the wall/ceiling after applying the knockdown texture, you can also paint it an off-white color beforehand. That way, the white, unpainted texture will provide a subtle color contrast.","Creating a knockdown texture on a wall or ceiling is a great way to hide small imperfections and add visual interest to the surface. Doing the job right requires the proper technique, a steady hand, and specialized equipment, including an air-powered joint compound spray gun. The trick is to spray on the texture lightly and evenly, then to “knock it down” gently and quickly. With some practice, this is a project that most DIYers can handle.","Washing your walls is a fantastic way to deep clean and refresh your home.

Practice getting out of a chair without rocking forward, especially if you work at a desk from 9-5.

Anthony Fittizzi, managing director and wealth strategist at U.S. Trust, tells his clients that a trust places safeguards around how beneficiaries can access and spend the money that's been left to them. You can also dictate how your money is spent in the future when you set up a trust. That's a great way to ensure that your wealth preservation strategies continue throughout future generations. You may set up a stipulation that the money in the trust can only be used for educational purposes, for instance, or that it will be dispensed in set a yearly or monthly sum. Be aware that once you place your assets in a trust, they are no longer considered to be your assets.","The terms ""rich"" and ""wealthy"" are often used interchangeably, but in fact they are two different concepts. Wealth relates to how much money you have in the bank, and the security of your assets. To be rich, and stay rich, is more of an attitude, a state of mind that doesn't necessarily relate to your assets, but your quality of life. However, if you're looking to turn a big paycheck or other assets (stocks, real estate, an inheritance, etc.) into lasting wealth, or ""stay rich,"" you'll need to learn to manage your money, making careful choices to ensure your assets won't disappear when the going gets tough. Of course, you can't take your money with you when you die, but you can follow certain steps to stay rich so that it lasts through your life.","Everyone should have an estate plan. Trusts of different types are a popular way to plan for the transfer of your assets after your death. Whether you choose a simple revocable living trust or a very complicated irrevocable testamentary-style trust, with some upfront study and work, you can both make the best choice for your family and cut down on headaches of making your final plans.","","An irrevocable trust is a trust that cannot be revoked during the lifetime of the person who creates the trust, commonly referred to as the ""settlor"" or the ""grantor."" This means that, once the settler's property is transferred to the trust, it cannot be transferred back to the settlor. Irrevocable trusts are most often used to protect assets from creditors or to obtain certain tax advantages. While it is advisable to enlist the help of an attorney when setting up this type of trust, it is possible to do it yourself.","","Although the idea of a trust fund is generally associated with estate planning for the very wealthy, middle class families can also benefit from the tax advantages and privacy of a trust fund. The idea that you have to be rich to utilize a trust fund is a fallacy.  Trust funds allow people to distribute their property and assets to beneficiaries without having to involve the courts in the probate process and without having to pay some estate taxes.  You can set up a trust fund with the assistance of a trust and estates attorney, or you can draw up the documents yourself.","Trust is a fundamental factor in creating and maintaining meaningful relationships. Trusting in someone can mean everything from telling a person your deepest secrets to knowing they'll be on time for an appointment. There are many levels of trust, but all require you to put your faith in someone.","","A trust is a probate-free approach to passing assets to your beneficiaries when you die. When you create a “revocable” trust, you fund the trust during your lifetime and can change the trust or cancel it at any time. Trusts are governed by state law, so be sure you are in accord with any local requirements before proceeding. To create this type of trust, you should identify the property you want to transfer. Then you need to draft a trust document, in which you explain who should receive the property when you die. If you have questions, consult a qualified trusts and estates attorney. While a trust may avoid probate and other such entanglements, it will not avoid taxes on an estate or income associated with the trust property in any way. Note that while another name for a revocable trust is a ""living trust,"" this is not the same as a living will and should not be confused with it.","","All parents want to make sure their family is taken care of after their death. Trusts are increasing in popularity as an alternative to traditional wills and probate. With some planning, you can create a pool of your assets that will be managed and used to benefit and support your child after your death.","","Everyone should have an estate plan. Trusts of different types are a popular way to plan for the transfer of your assets after your death. Whether you choose a simple revocable living trust or a very complicated irrevocable testamentary-style trust, with some upfront study and work, you can both make the best choice for your family and cut down on headaches of making your final plans.","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"

As you search through job advertisements, prepare your application, and face the interview, there are small steps you can take to help increase your chances of success. Read the job advertisement carefully to make sure you have all of the proper materials for your application. Each school asks for something different, and will ask for it by a certain date as well. Make sure each application has all of the documentation you need, or else the search committee probably won’t read your materials. Tailor your application materials to the school you are applying to. Every school is a little bit different, and will look for different things in their students and faculty. Make sure your materials discuss how you will be a good fit for the school and department. If your advisor knows someone in the department, he will probably have some good advice for things you can say to ingratiate yourself quickly. If you get an interview, make sure you are prepared for the big moments, which include explaining your research and interacting with future colleagues. You will be expected to discuss your research, both formally in a job talk, and informally in conversation with other faculty. Make sure you can discuss your work in a compact and coherent way, and that you keep to the time allotted. A job talk should not run over, and informal conversation should be kept to within 5 minutes (the  “elevator pitch”). The interview is also a way for the other faculty to see what kind of colleague you will be, so make sure to study their research interests, and ask them about the projects they are working on.","Chemistry teachers help future scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals develop the foundations in chemistry they will need to further their college studies and launch their careers. They also help other students gain an understanding of how the world around them works.

This is an important step in the baking process to ensure that the finished product doesn't stick to the sides of the pan. By greasing and flouring the pan you're creating 2 layers of non-stick protection. To do this, all you'll need to do is choose your greasing agent, decide between flour or cocoa powder, and make sure to cover every crevice of your baking pan.","If you’re working full-time and looking for some extra money, it may be time to consider getting a second job. Searching and applying for another job is a similar process to looking for your first job with a few caveats. Whether it be part-time or temporary, be honest with employers and you may find the ideal second job for you.","An employment agency can be helpful in matching you and your qualifications to companies and organizations that are looking for workers. Looking for work through an employment or staffing agency will help take a lot of the searching out of your hands. Agencies have access to employers that you do not. Find a job using an employment agency by filling out an application at the agency, talking to recruiters and job placement professionals about the type of work you are looking for and following their advice on resume and interview techniques.","The internet is a great resource for job seekers, but it can also be a bit overwhelming if you approach it without a gameplan. Your best way to find a job online is to boost your online presence by creating a professional website and/or LinkedIn profile.

When you find a job that appeals to you, act fast and put in a professional application with strong supporting materials.","Loving what you do makes it easier to wake up in the morning and get your job done.

Using university resources and searching diligently for opportunities are the keys to landing an accounting job.","Physicians usually find a job by networking. That works, but you can never be sure that you have contacted every possible employer / physician. By mailing a letter to every single physician in the area where you want to live and work you contact absolutely everybody. This allows you to find the best job you can get. This method is superior to any other means of finding a physician job!","Maybe your current job just isn’t working out, or maybe you just graduated and are trying to get employed for the first time. The job market can be hard to crack in either case, no matter your age or experience. Start by networking and searching online for job openings, tailoring your resume and cover letter to match what employers are seeking, and then sending in stand-out applications. The process may seem daunting, but going in with determination and a plan will carry you through until you find the perfect opportunity.","Job searching when you already have a job can be difficult, but sometimes it is the best thing you can do for your career. Many people only look for a job when they are forced to. Doing it on your own time gives you more security and flexibility to find the best possible offer. Searches have to be kept quiet in order to avoid problems in your current workplace. Update your resume and hone your interview skills as you apply for new roles. While you still have to balance your old responsibilities, you can use your job search to take advantage of bigger and better opportunities.","There are so many scams offering the opportunity to earn money at home that it can be difficult to believe that there are legitimate opportunities out there.

Equipping yourself is therefore important. The three main categories of firearms are pistols (handguns), shotguns, and rifles. The very first step is to intimately familiarize yourself with firearm safety rules. For example, be sure of your target and what's beyond it. Don't shoot your teenage son sneaking back into the house. Also, remember that most likely the bullets you are firing will go through the walls in your house, and could therefore strike loved ones. Consider tactically preparing yourself with a pistol for suggestions on arming yourself with a pistols. Pistols are a lightweight, efficient, and popular choice for personal defense. An alternative, and highly recommended, firearm to have would be a pump-action shotgun. Shotguns have much better stopping power than a pistol. A pump-action is recommended as reliability is of the utmost importance, but you can also use break-action shotguns to good effect. Don't be fooled by those who say that shotguns are point and shoot. Shotguns take as much training and practice as pistols and rifles. Rifles are the third common option. Rifles, again, produce (even in some smaller calibers) significantly more stopping power than most pistols, but they require just as much precision. A magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifle is the suggested choice as two hands may not always be available, and the option to quickly shoot multiple rounds is often a welcome one.","Clearing or searching a building when someone may be in it (who also may have a weapon) is a very dangerous task, and should not be taken lightly. Police and military have training for such circumstances, but the normal citizen is usually less than knowledgeable on the subject. Although the authorities should always be contacted in the event of a suspected break-in, knowing how to clear the building yourself may help you to keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the event that help cannot arrive in time. This article, for the purpose of simplification, will assume you are in your house.","Police, military, and concerned citizens must objectively and thoroughly choose a handgun which fits their needs. The decision can be difficult, as the list of handguns is long and there is no perfect handgun, no perfect caliber, and no perfect bullet. The most important consideration is to get a gun that you feel comfortable shooting, not the gun you think you need. Your comfort holding and shooting a gun is far more important than the ""right"" caliber or bullet.","If the flush valve on your toilet stops working properly or you have a leak, it can be time to replace the flush valve.

That said, there are a variety of ""correct"" scopes available, so knowing more what you want, not what you think you ""need,"" is the most important thing.","Most responsible gun owners believe it is important to store their firearms and ammunition safely. One advantage to choosing a gun cabinet over a gun safe is that in addition to storing the guns securely, you can also display them. Gun cabinets come in a variety of sizes and styles. Select a gun cabinet that can store and display your collection of firearms, and make sure it includes a sturdy lock that will keep your guns out of the hands of children and intruders.","Mailing dangerous items like firearms can be a tricky business. If you don’t hold a valid Federal Firearms License (FFL), you’re not legally authorized to manufacture or sell firearms in the United States. Therefore, you need to know the restrictions you’ll have to work within when you mail a firearm in the U.S. If you do hold an FFL, you’ll have more shipping options, but you still need to obey the law. No matter what your status is, knowing your legal obligations will make the shipping process go more smoothly.","A bewildering variety of shotguns and ammo are available, potentially making it difficult for someone to make a purchase.

Read on for a basic primer on handgun safety and accuracy.","Selecting a weapon for defensive purposes is a crucial and daunting decision. Generally speaking, there are two types of guns: handguns and long guns. Handguns are designed for one handed use and portability, but generally lack the stopping power of long guns, which range from shotguns to rifles to submachine guns. Keep reading for help in choosing which type you need.","Police, military, and concerned citizens must objectively and thoroughly choose a handgun which fits their needs. The decision can be difficult, as the list of handguns is long and there is no perfect handgun, no perfect caliber, and no perfect bullet. The most important consideration is to get a gun that you feel comfortable shooting, not the gun you think you need. Your comfort holding and shooting a gun is far more important than the ""right"" caliber or bullet.","Learning the right way to grip a pistol will improve your aim and keep you safer on the shooting range. A two-handed grip is recommended under most circumstances, but there are occasions when it helps to know how to grip the gun with one hand. You should also make yourself aware of common grip mistakes you need to avoid.","2","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"

Do not wear flashy outfits, bright colors, baggy clothing, or low-cutting blouses or dresses. You do not have to wear all black, but at least dress in darker colors, like dark blues, greens, and grays. As a general rule of thumb, dress business casual when attending funerals. Remember, a funeral is not the right time to make a fashion statement. However, if the dresscode states no black, avoid the colour entirely- men can still wear black trousers.","Whether you are attending a funeral for the first time, or haven't been to one in years, there are a few general rules and guidelines to abide by. When attending a funeral, remember to arrive early, dress in darker colors, and offer your condolences to the family. However, if you are attending a religious funeral whose customs you are not familiar with, researching the denomination's customs beforehand will help you feel more at ease when attending the funeral.","Although the term ‘conservative’ is often applied to a person’s political leanings, there are actually a number of different ways you can be a conservative girl. For instance, you might choose to dress conservatively even if you lean to the left politically—especially if you’re traveling to a place where you’ll be expected to dress modestly. Similarly, you might choose to live a conservative lifestyle, even if you dress radically. However you choose to embody being conservative, remember, the important thing is to always be true to yourself!","Beets are beloved by many—they contain lots of beneficial vitamins and minerals, work well in a plethora of recipes, and, when cooked properly, boast a rich, earthy flavor. There are many ways to prepare beets, but one of the best methods is boiling, which softens up the tough root vegetable without robbing it of its natural juices. Just throw your beets in a deep pot, cover them with water, add a splash of vinegar or lemon juice, and simmer them until they’re tender, about 30-45 minutes.","Dresses are extremely versatile items because they can be both easily dressed up and worn casually. To make any dress in your closet more casual, you can use a layering technique, or you can pick a pair of shoes that are less dressy. If you think your dress is still too fancy, you can add simple accessories.","","Although the term ‘conservative’ is often applied to a person’s political leanings, there are actually a number of different ways you can be a conservative girl.

Luckily,  showing off your style in comfortable, practical clothing is easy and fun!","Sometimes it seems political debate is so polarized there is no point in talking to someone on the other side of the issues. But debate is important, and a liberal debating a conservative can learn valuable lessons (and vice versa) from engaging with someone else with a different perspective. Stay respectful and listen -- in addition to learning about political views, you will also learn a lot about the other person and how they became the individual they are.","Dressing to look good or even just look appropriate for particular situations can be really complex.

It may be hard to find others in your community who understand you. Even in the classroom, you may feel like the instructors are biased and not willing to listen to your perspective. Being open to sharing your beliefs may help you find others who agree with you, and may even help bring a more balanced perspective to your campus.","Dressage shows are often formal events and it can be daunting choosing what to wear for this traditional equestrian sport. For most dressage shows you need to wear a jacket, riding shirt, and breeches. You also need to wear a helmet, stock tie, and tall riding boots. Some dressage shows give you the option of wearing spurs or a body protector. Once you have planned how to dress for the event, you can focus on having a fun day out with your horse!","Sometimes it seems like beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder, doesn't it?

In most entertainment fields and in politics as well, you'll need to get in touch with an agent who can help to represent you and set you up with auditions, contacts, and jobs while you focus on the more important work of being the best you can be. Usually, agents will take a percentage of what you make, but sometimes not at first. You may have to be willing to make periodic installments to pay your agent to get you to work at first. Be judicious in picking an agent who'll work with you and get you the contacts and the work that you need.","Are you ready for your close-up? Being a star takes a lot more than luck.

To get an agent, you’ll have to create a worthwhile portfolio, locate agents you think are a good match for you and your work, and then contact and secure the services of an agent.

You (and your puppet!) can make use of the space on stage, make eye contact with various members of the audience, and be animated throughout your routine. Use lots of gestures and facial expressions to draw people’s attention to you and your puppet. Choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident, and do the same for your puppet! You could have your puppet choose a member of the audience to speak to. People will enjoy being included in the show.","Ventriloquism is the art of making an inanimate object seem to come alive. The first step in becoming a good ventriloquist is to choose a puppet that matches the character you are trying to create. You’ll also need to work on “throwing” your voice, using a different accent or tone, and speaking without moving your lips. Animating your puppet is another aspect of ventriloquism, so practice moving the puppet’s mouth and body in time with what they are saying. Develop a routine and dialogue between yourself and the puppet -- complete with good jokes. Keep practicing, and have fun!","Having a good stage presence is crucial to creating an engaging and lasting performance. While talent and practice are of course essential to any creative performance, nervous body language or unbelievable vocal patterns can kill the energy on stage. Whatever the performance medium, from music to acting to dancing, good stage presence gives the crowd the impression that you are in control and having fun. Most importantly, developing confidence in both your art and your ability to be a good performer will keep the crowd excited and energized throughout the show, and leave them wanting more.","Shuffling a deck of playing cards is usually the first step to playing any card game. There are several different ways to shuffle cards, from a simple overhand shuffle to the more advanced Hindu shuffle or riffle shuffle.

When faced with difficult circumstances, some people falter and spiral towards self-destruction while others survive and even thrive once the storm has passed.  No one is completely immune to adversity, but some people seem to be better able to cope with and recover from even the most strenuous conditions. To develop your own mental, physical, or spiritual strength, follow these suggestions.","Designing an artistic, effective, and practical theatrical set poses many challenges. The good news is that although set designs differ greatly, there’re several basic principles you can follow for any play, opera, or other type of performance. Begin by reading the play and envisioning what stage set components the audience members need to see to bring the play to life. Also keep in mind budgetary restrictions and the level of production that you’re staging.","Building a stage can provide a great addition to a playroom, or provide an elevated platform for a performance. By combining multiple stage platforms, you can build a stage in any shape or size you desire. Using a few basic tools and some lumber from your local home improvement store, it is possible to create a sturdy stage that will last for years.","Whether you are new to theatre or not, becoming intimately familiar with your character is essential to a great performance. To do this, you will need to read the script multiple times, research the time period and setting, and think in terms of objectives instead of feelings. You can also create a sketch of your character by asking yourself questions about your character’s physical, social, psychological and moral attributes. Additionally, make sure to use rehearsal time to develop your character further.","Remember everything in life can be learned.  In the case of a quality such as 'presence', the learning is learning to control your mindset.  'In with the good, out with the bad"".","","As a lead singer, your main job is to keep the audience engaged and entertained. Start by practicing your songs until you know them by heart. While on stage, show the audience your enthusiasm for the music by moving around and interacting with your bandmates. Talk with the audience between songs and reach out to touch them, if you feel safe doing so.","Do you tend to overreact when someone says something hurtful? It's normal to feel a sting when someone criticizes or insults you. However, if you tend to lash out in anger, cry, or feel upset for days, you may want to focus on developing a thicker skin. While there's nothing wrong with being sensitive, it's no fun to get knocked off balance by a casual comment. By learning to look at the bigger picture, having a positive attitude and building confidence, you can stand strong the next time you feel insulted.","Having a good stage presence is crucial to creating an engaging and lasting performance.

Spend money only on the essentials, and look for cheaper options where available, from housing to food, transportation, or energy usage. Save for an emergency fund. Spend money on luxuries only occasionally.","When you think of bicep curls, you might picture some muscle-bound guy at the gym grunting while he jacks up a giant dumbbell.  When done properly, however, bicep curls are one of the simplest weightlifting moves to employ, and valuable to anyone seeking to build or maintain arm strength and muscle tone.  The key point is to focus on proper technique, instead of trying to max out on the weights and allowing your form to break down in the process. Make sure to keep your workout balanced by working the back of your arms equally, such as by doing tricep exercises.","Achieving financial and personal independence is a great feeling, and is manageable with some hard work and careful budgeting.

Set a date for when you will ask again. Until that time, be sure to kick your work into high gear. Don't slack off just because you're disappointed that you won't be getting a raise yet.","If you feel like you have been doing an excellent job at work, don't be afraid to approach your employer for a raise. Many people are afraid to ask for raises even though they know they deserve them, making excuses like, ""The economy is so down right now"" or ""I'll never find a good time."" If this sounds like you, then it's time to stop getting in your own way and to start making a game plan for getting the higher salary you deserve.","When obstacles arrive, persistence can help you move over, around, or through them. The application of persistence to any task is often what sets apart successful people. Spending time each day working towards your goal, for example, increases your odds of success. It’s also important to ignore your detractors and keep going when you are faced with hardship or failure. Being persistent means putting one foot in front of the other, no matter what.","Everyone needs a break from everyday life, and camping can be a great way to get outdoors and surround yourself with nature. When you start planning your trip, make sure to choose a campsite that fits your needs and pack the materials you need. Once you have your camp set up, you can find nearby activities to explore and have fun while you relax. Even after a short camping trip, you'll feel refreshed and appreciate the great outdoors!","","Have the words headstrong, obstinate and unwilling to change been used to describe you? Standing your ground is important, but so are compromise, cooperation, and collaboration. Your stubbornness may be the reason you aren’t being invited to events, and you may be losing friendships and even job prospects. If you put your foot down and refuse to budge on anything, then it is time for change. Taking charge of your stubbornness involves using practical techniques, developing negotiation skills and analyzing the reasons for your stubbornness.","Being tough is about much more than talking a big game. Tough people handle difficult situations with strength and grace. They stay positive instead of letting cynicism rule the day, and they're the ones who volunteer to help when someone needs to take the lead. Like wisdom, toughness can only be acquired through experience. In fact, every problem you have to face down gives you a chance to get tougher. Next time you encounter a tricky obstacle, will you waver and wilt, or will you choose to be tough?","Being stubborn doesn’t always have to be a bad thing. In fact, sometimes a healthy dose of stubbornness is just what you need in order to push yourself to get what you want. To truly be stubborn, you have to know how to stick up for what you believe in and not give in to other people, even if it’s the easier thing to do. Sometimes, this may even require you to be a bit annoying, but hey, if it gets you what you want, then more power to you!","Consistency is a great characteristic to build and implement in your life.  The key to consistency is setting and achieving specific goals. Start by determining how you want to be more consistent in your life, and aim for these small goals. Over time, as you become more consistent, keep yourself motivated and accountable. This may require some change in thinking so that you stay optimistic and productive throughout the process.","Life is full of unexpected twists and turns. Some are inconsequential while others are life-altering.

You can improve your mental resilience by learning from your experiences, cultivating realistic optimism, taking care of yourself after a setback, getting up, and moving forward in your day-to-day life.","A chronic cough can be a real annoyance and sometimes, a sign of another condition. You can try home remedies and over-the-counter medications, but if your cough persists, you should see your doctor. They will likely recommend a treatment appropriate to whatever condition is causing your cough, which will hopefully bring you some relief!","When obstacles arrive, persistence can help you move over, around, or through them.

While petitions and protests demonstrate public interest in the arts, individual letters show dedication and commitment to a cause. Research online to see which members of government will be voting on funding for the arts, and direct your letter to one of those individuals. Explain how the arts have positively impacted your life, and why funding is important. Be sure to include your return address on the letter, so the government official can potentially write you back. You can write to some members of government via email. You can find their contact information here: https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials. Consider calling a legislator on the phone to speak with them directly. This may be more efficient than sending a letter through the mail.","The arts allow people to publicly express themselves in fun, creative, and meaningful ways. Art, music, and theatre all provide countless creators, musicians, and entertainers with a livelihood. Without public support and proper funding, though, these mediums may begin fading from local communities. You can help support the arts by providing financial assistance, attending community functions, and petitioning officials from your school and government.","Writing a letter to a government official can be a great way to weigh in on what's going on in your nation, state, or locality. Search online for the official mailing address of the leader that you wish to contact. The proper addressing etiquette varies from official to official, so make sure to look up the standard for the specific person to whom you are sending the letter!","Nail trimming is an important task that keeps your dog’s nails short and healthy. It also keeps your floors and furniture safe from snags and scratches! Long nails can break and bleed, or they can grow back into the paw and cause pain.  They can also make a dog lame if they interfere with normal paw movement. Regular nail trimming will prevent these problems and give you a chance to check the nails for any abnormalities.","Knowing how to write a letter is a fundamental skill you'll use in business, school, and personal relationships to communicate information, goodwill, or just affection. Here is a basic guide on how to put your thoughts on paper in the correct format.","The Attorney General is responsible for prosecuting violations of the law under their jurisdiction. Writing a letter to the Attorney General is a last recourse in most situations.  The Attorney General is only likely to respond to questions that are of wide public significance. Large scale consumer fraud or protests over public policy are the most appropriate subjects for such a letter.","Pitch letters are an important aspect of getting interviews and having news articles written about your product or company. Editors and producers receive piles of pitch letters every day, so you need to learn how to write a pitch letter that will make you stand out from the others, increasing your chances of getting asked for more information.","There are occasions when you may find it pertinent to write a letter to a judge. You may believe that what you have to say can impact how a judge approaches the task of sentencing someone you know. Knowing what to include in your letter and how to say it can determine how effective the letter ends up being. That is why it is important to format the letter properly and make sure that the content of the letter is effective and not detrimental to the defendant's case. Do not communicate with a judge if you are a party yourself to a criminal trial because it is generally illegal to do so.","When you hire an attorney, you will need to communicate with him frequently so that he obtains all of the necessary evidence to presenting a strong case on your behalf.  Generally, your attorney will reach out to you when he needs information and give you specific instructions for how to respond.  However, there are certain occasions in which you may wish to contact your attorney with a question or request.  While you should always choose the method of communication that makes you feel most comfortable (i.e. by phone, email, in person), you may prefer to write your attorney a formal letter to highlight the importance of your message.","","There are many reasons for writing a letter to the District Attorney (DA). Whatever your reason, you’ll want to draft a formal, respectful letter to give your inquiry the best chance of success. You’ll also want to include all the information necessary to support your inquiry, whether it involves a trial, reporting a crime, or dealing with a traffic ticket.","A letter to Authority is similar to a ""Letter of persuasion"".  However it should not be mixed with a ""Letter of Complaint""; its main aim is to try to convince and persuade an authority figure into doing something, or changing his mind on a particular matter.  For instance, your boss at work decided to cancel some employee benefits such as free transportation for all workers, due to budget cuts.  You can write a letter to your boss to argue your position.","The IRS is one of the most feared government agencies. However, you have nothing to fear when you need to write them a letter. Format a business letter and remember to get to the point. People usually write the IRS to provide missing information, ask for an abatement, or appeal an IRS decision. Provide all necessary information and remember to keep a copy of the letter for your records.","Writing to a legislator is an effective method of influencing their perspectives on a variety of issues. It also allows you to build and maintain a relationship with your elected officials and express your opinion and standpoints on a variety of issues that are affecting you and your community. Additionally, if there is specific legislation that you would like to express your support or opposition for, or ask questions about, writing to your legislator would be a great way to do that. Legislators play an integral role in the politics and laws of the country and state you reside in.

Designate an area in your yard to put your yard waste, fruit peels, and uneaten food. After a while, you'll be able to use it to fertilize your lawn or garden. Unfortunately for us and our children, landfills are slowly running out of room. Composting slows the growth of these facilities, making them last longer and ultimately putting trash to good use. It also is a cheaper alternative to reinvigorating soil.That means less methane in our air to boot!","At the rate we're going, it can seem sometimes like we're out to destroy our planet. Luckily, there are a bunch of efforts you can make that are easy, quick, and cost-effective, so you can do your part in taking care of our only home in the galaxy. See Step 1 for more information.","Composting is one of the simplest ways you can make a positive impact on the environment. Instead of tossing your food and garden scraps into your trash, you simply add them to your compost bin. To get started, pick a spot for your compost pile, then purchase or build a compost bin. As you add scraps, turn the compost regularly to help everything decompose evenly. Then, use your composted soil to grow healthy houseplants, landscaping, or even your own veggie garden!","A clogged toilet is something we've all experienced: the rising of water to the brim, the sense of panic as it doesn't stop, the scurrying for the plunger. But dish soap is a simple solution that can bring you back from the fate of a flood of toilet water with nothing but your favorite product and some hot water! Whether you start by pouring the boiling water into the toilet or adding dish soap, if all goes well the end result is unclogged piping.","Many types of leaves are rich in minerals and other healthy organic materials. Because of this, you can use leaves from your backyard or a public park to make inexpensive compost every fall. In order to speed up the leaves’ decaying process, try grinding them up using a shredder or lawnmower. Compost enriches the nutrient content of garden soil and flower beds, and allows you to re-use food scraps and other organic items that would otherwise go to waste.","","Composting is one of the simplest ways you can make a positive impact on the environment.

As you add scraps, turn the compost regularly to help everything decompose evenly. Then, use your composted soil to grow healthy houseplants, landscaping, or even your own veggie garden!","","","Compost is a nutrient-rich mixture of organic matter used by gardeners and farmers to help grow strong, healthy plants and flowers.  In addition to providing nutrients that help improve depleted soil at no additional cost, compost piles also have the added benefit of recycling many common lawn and household waste products that would otherwise end up in landfills. Although the initial decomposition time can be lengthy, once a compost pile is active, keeping it going is easy. This article explains how to maintain a compost heap.","One of the keys to successful composting is aeration.  Bacteria need oxygen to carry out the aerobic respiration that creates a rich compost.  One way to aerate your compost is with a pitchfork or a compost turning tool. This can be an arduous task.  Using a tumbling composter can make things easier.  Since most tumbling composters can be fairly expensive, costing well over $100, consider building your own.  For much less money and a few hours of your time, you can build your own tumbling composter by following the steps below.","","","If you have your own compost bin, you know that your nice, well-rotted fertilizer gets mixed in with large scraps that need more time to decay. Assemble a compost screen, and you can quickly separate these two types of compost and transfer them to different bins.","1","4","3","4","0","1","4","0","2","4","2","4"

As with the primer, use a paint pan and a roller with a telescoping handle and a low-nap roller pad. Acrylic pool paint rolls on like typical house paint. Use the roller pan to work a small amount of paint into the roller pad, then apply the paint with smooth, even strokes. Use a paintbrush for corners and tight spaces. Start at the deep end of the pool and work your way to the shallowest part—otherwise, you’ll paint yourself into the deep end! You’ll likely need around 7–8 US gal (26–30 L) of acrylic pool paint to apply 2 coats to a 16 ft × 32 ft (4.9 m × 9.8 m) pool. Rubber and epoxy pool paints are usually thicker, but can still be applied with rollers and brushes. The amount you need may vary versus acrylic, so check the product instructions.","If you have a brand-new concrete swimming pool, or a concrete pool with a failing paint job, applying pool paint is a DIY project that can add both beauty and longevity to your swimming spot. For an existing pool, it’s important to drain, patch, and clean the pool properly before painting. When it’s time to paint either a new or old pool, choose a DIY-friendly acrylic pool paint that you can apply with a standard paint roller and brush.","Using a paint roller is a quick way to modify the interior and exterior walls of your home. While paint brushes might seem like the easier choice, you will actually save yourself a lot of time by opting for a paint roller instead. Paint rollers will cover a larger surface area than a paintbrush and will provide an equally smooth finish to large and small areas. Before you begin rolling on paint, you need to purchase the right type of roller for the job and learn how to apply the paint effectively. Otherwise, you may end up with a streaky or splotchy finish.","","","You can easily get rid of the varnish and give a wooden item or surface an instant upgrade. Wash your item, fill in any uneven spots with wood putty, and sand the surface. Apply 1-2 coats of primer, let it dry, then apply 2-3 coats of water-based paint. With some preparation and paint, you can transform your wooden furniture and surfaces like furniture, staircases, and flooring.","Billiards (or pool) is an entertaining game that, with practice, you can master and use to your advantage when taking bets. Learn how to draw your very own billiard ball using this tutorial!","Whether you’re painting your house or painting on a canvas, getting the paint off of your paintbrush is the best way to prolong the lifespan and effectiveness of it. It’s also really easy! You just need to use the right solution for the paint that’s on the brush. For water-based or latex paints, a good, soapy scrubbing should do the trick. For oil-based paints, you’ll need to use a paint stripper to help you scrub off the paint. You can also use hot vinegar as a natural cleaning alternative for most paints.","When you spray paint your car yourself, you first apply a primer, then a base coat, and then a clear coat, but it can be difficult to get these coats to look even because the paint has a tendency to run. Thankfully, with some patience and the right tools, you can get that perfect glossy finish and save thousands of dollars on a professional paint job. You’ll need to devote several days to the process and make sure to follow safety guidelines.","If you have a brand-new concrete swimming pool, or a concrete pool with a failing paint job, applying pool paint is a DIY project that can add both beauty and longevity to your swimming spot.

When it’s time to paint either a new or old pool, choose a DIY-friendly acrylic pool paint that you can apply with a standard paint roller and brush.","Painting over gloss paint isn’t difficult, but it does require a fair amount of time and special treatment to produce a clean and consistent finish. Start by lightly sanding the gloss paint and then cleaning the surface so you can remove the glossy surface that makes it difficult for paint to adhere to. Then, apply a base coat of bonding primer to help your paint stick to the surface. Use at least 2 coats of paint, and allow each coat to fully dry in between applications.","Painting a dress is a great way to take it to the next level and make it truly unique. The simplest way to paint the dress is to spread it out on a flat surface and apply fabric paint with a brush. If you want an airbrushed look, however, you'll need to put the dress onto a dress form, then apply fabric spray paint instead.","","Painting can be a lot of fun, especially when you can let loose and color outside the lines. Splatter painting can be even more fun because there are no lines restricting your creativity! Splatter painting is an easy and expressive way to create abstract art that simply requires a canvas, paint, and an open mind for disorder!","1","1","1","4","1","1","4","2","2","2","1","4"

With a bit of Internet research, you'll get a good grasp of what companies are legit and which ones aren't. For starters, never accept a gig that requires transferring money. Some places will send you to ""scope out Western Union"" or something similar and they'll issue you a false check. You'll transfer it, the bank catches up to you eventually, and you have to pay it off. No thank you. In the US, you will not be asked any of your super-private (think SSN) information until you make $600 in one year from one company -- that's the mark when taxes start applying. If you do hit this, they'll send you a 1099 and everything will be confidential and official. Remember the IRS expects all income to be reported even if you do not receive a 1099.","You've probably gotten those junk emails about becoming a secret shopper -- getting paid to eat, paid to shop, paid to do what you already normally do -- and you're intrigued. Is it legitimate? It sure can be! After you read this page, you'll know the ins and outs of free food, new shopping experiences, and a paycheck to boot. In other words, the best job ever.","Becoming a mystery shopper can seem like an appealing opportunity to make some extra money.

Job seekers beware, they are out to get you too. Sure it seems harmless to write an article or research a specific topic before being compensated, but some scammers can be very clever and it is important to be cautious. Always look for red flags, research the company, and ask pertinent questions before trusting an online posting. Scroll down to Step 1 for more information.","","There are so many online scammers that wait for the right moment to trap you with wrong intentions. These scammers might call you and claim to be from reputed tech support providing companies. They might try to trick you into scams related to wired money, sweepstakes, or other convincing scenarios.

Should you want to try your hand at taking surveys to make extra money, you need to know how to spot the red flags, investigate suspicious sites, and report a fraudulent site to the proper authorities. Thousands of people have fallen prey to these types of scams in the past, so it’s important learn how to protect yourself from shady operators.","Is someone damaging your online reputation?

Swales researched the structure of introductions found in academic articles and came up with a process of ""moves"" that result in a succinct, well-formatted and clear introduction. To follow this model,  establish the research territory by introducing the topic, saying why it is relevant, and outlining previous research on it.

When you're eating lunch, just eat lunch. Focus entirely on nourishing your body, slowing down, enjoying what you eat. When you're reading the newspaper, just focus on learning, reading the words, and understanding the concepts. Put yourself completely into each task. This can be surprisingly difficult, and it won't happen right away. Buzzing text alerts and constant 21st century noise can make it hard to slow down and focus.

Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, or other forms of psychological therapy are helpful when you're unlearning negative thinking and establishing patterns of thinking that support your self-esteem and increase your self confidence. While it is best to read up in this area and speak with someone qualified to help guide you through the ways to change your thinking, there are some important things to keep in mind. Acknowledge the feeling will pass. This can be a very difficult step, but it's vital because it helps you to start banishing thoughts of hopelessness. List all of your good points. When you're depressed, it's easy to understate the positive things about yourself. Turn this around by listing everything that is good about you. Include achievements from the past and hopes for the future, however few or random they may seem. If you can't write this list, have a trusted friend or family member start one for you. This is a list to keep building upon as you work through your depression. Self-acceptance is a vital part of recovering from depression because you acknowledge that there are good things about yourself, but also that you have challenges to overcome. This will help you stop judging yourself more harshly than anyone else. Make decisions, however small, and act on them. Again, while this is very difficult to do during depression, it is a vital element in facing the sense of helplessness that tends to overwhelm depressed persons. Small decisions like getting out of bed, calling friends, or cleaning up the kitchen all add up. Once you act on them, they become achievements. Learn how to replace faulty or negative thinking by focusing on it. Ask questions such as: Am I assuming the worst? Am I condemning myself because something bad has happened? Am I focused on my weaknesses rather than my strengths? It is helpful to arrange the negative thought in one column and a rationalization in another column, so that you can confront and undo the negative thinking. In one column you may write the thought: ""I'm a failure,"" and in the other you challenge that thought with: ""I made a mistake. I've made mistakes in the past and things have turned out okay. I've also had many triumphs."" Learn assertiveness techniques once you've challenged the harder aspects of your negative thinking processes. Assertive techniques will allow you to find a pathway to standing up for yourself without giving in to feelings of anger, fear, or powerlessness. Knowing how to assert yourself is an important part of not falling back into depressive patterns in the future.","","","","Most people feel dissatisfied with their lives or even themselves at some point.  If you feel like you need a fundamental change to who you are, you are in luck; you can change!  Major change can seem daunting, but it is entirely possible if you are willing to set and stick with clear goals.  Changing what you do can ultimately lead to a change in how you perceive yourself overall.","","Sometimes, when things are becoming monotonous, or you just can't stand 'it' anymore, what you might need is to change the way you're looking at things and doing them  and maybe even switch things up entirely. This article will help you to discover the way to change your focus.","Negative thoughts are detrimental to our overall health and well-being.  At some time in our lives we have all suffered from them, but perpetually engaging in negative thinking can lead to a lower quality of life.  Without intervention, you can soon find yourself feeling sad or depressed, as continually dwelling on negative thoughts can lead to sleepless nights, tension, or anxiety.  However, you can overcome these feelings by challenging your negative mindset, becoming more positive, and focusing on enjoying life more.","","A negative outlook on life can have serious consequences to your health, your relationships, and your feelings of satisfaction in life. Changing your attitude can be achieved through mindful, conscious thought and attention. Generating a positive attitude, practicing gratitude, and selectively forming new habits that promote positivity is a life-long process that can result in a changed attitude.","Change is inevitable in life, but that does not need to be a bad thing. A great man once said that ""In order to change anything, you must first change yourself.""

If you’re no longer satisfied with the version of yourself that you show to other people, it may be time to alter your public image. Changing your image isn’t about overriding who you are as a person, but embracing certain values and characteristics and making them part of the behavior that you project outwardly. To start, all you need to do is recognize the traits that you want to develop, work on modifying your habits and update your look to reflect your new sense of self.","This wikiHow teaches you how to change your cell phone number for common carriers, including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.","The reason doesn't really matter, but maybe you need a little change in your life.

No matter how close you and your parent are, both of you should still maintain personal boundaries. These are guidelines that help both of you feel safe and comfortable in the relationship. Sit down and have a discussion with your parent about boundaries. Share yours, and listen to theirs. For example, if you're an adult, you might express a boundary for your parent to call before visiting your home. Parents of adult children sometimes get pushy or over-involved out of good intentions. If your parent is overstepping their boundaries or behaving in a way that bothers you, respectfully let them know.","When you’re much younger, an equal friendship with a parent is generally off the table. That’s because traditional child-rearing practices like setting and enforcing rules get in the way. However, as a kid, you can still work to build a better relationship with your mom or dad. Then, when you become an adult, you can strive to continue that relationship on more of an equal playing field. No matter what, this person is still your parent, so prepare to set realistic expectations about the friendship, too.","A boundary is a space between you and another person. Think of it as a fence or a gate. As the gatekeeper, you can decide how close another person gets to you physically and emotionally. By setting boundaries, you allow the other person to prove his trustworthiness before you let him get closer into your life.","Pruning a rose bush can help encourages new growth and blooms, but it must be done properly.

The most successful packs in the wild are those where there are clear rules, boundaries and constraints; every dog knows its job and what it can and can’t do.  Their survival depends upon clear rules and consistency. This in itself offers the dog a sense of security. To give a dog the best possible start within our ‘pack’, we too need to clearly outline and instigate rules and boundaries.  Without these, our dog begins to display unwanted behaviours such as play-biting, jumping up uninvited, stealing and behaving like a real ‘wild child’!  Often we try to fix the actual problem but the underlying causes remain the same and the behaviour never really disappears. Here is a list of suggested rules, which should remain in place until the dog is at least 2 years old.","Setting boundaries in dating and relationships might seem difficult, but it is very possible. Setting boundaries is also important if you want to retain your sense of value while being in relationships. Often times, people get so wrapped up in accommodating others that their sense of self and their own boundaries may become a little loose. With that, they lose themselves and lower their self esteem in the process. If the boundaries you set are too rigid, you risk isolating yourself from the person you are involved with completely. It is important to strike a balance with the boundaries you set in dating to maintain healthy, functioning relationships.","In a relationship, you and your partner share many things. However, there may still be things you want to keep private. Setting privacy boundaries is part of a healthy relationship. To establish privacy boundaries, start by figuring out your privacy boundaries, and then talk to your partner about what your boundaries are by telling them specific things you want to keep private.","Setting boundaries with people, especially those you care about, can be difficult. You may feel guilty about doing so, but there’s no need to. You won’t be able to care for others if you can’t care for yourself. Setting up boundaries gives you a chance to practice this self-care and prevents you from feeling violated. Establishing boundaries with people like your partner, friends, and family may seem daunting, but it’s possible and necessary.","Children need to have clear boundaries. It helps them to be safe and be disciplined. As a parent, setting boundaries for your kids means setting fair boundaries, being firm, and knowing the importance of boundaries. With clear boundaries, you can raise a healthy and well-adjusted child.","","Many people think that being healthy is a difficult task that involves lots of dieting and time at the gym, but that's not actually true! By making some simple tweaks to your routine and setting small goals for yourself, you can be on the path toward living a healthier, happier life. Start a daily habit of making healthier choices when it comes to eating, relaxing, being active, and sleeping. Soon, you'll start to see your healthy life taking shape!","Setting clear and effective boundaries can be difficult for many people, especially those providing health and wellness care.

Pick nuts you like the taste of, grind them in a food processor, and add a small amount of honey or salt, to taste. As you grind, you might need to add a little oil to aid in the process. You can control the consistency and the flavor and make the kind of peanut butter you like. Remove the skins before grinding your peanuts on a high setting, adding oil as necessary. Use whatever peanuts you like to eat: Valencias, Virginias, Spanish peanuts, and Runners are all perfect for making peanut butter. Some prefer Spanish peanuts, because they have a slightly higher oil content. Raw peanuts can be used to make peanut butter, which will taste a little different than the more popular roasted variety. Try out honey-roasted peanuts for a special treat. You can also grind your own peanut butter at most natural food stores automatically. Like grinding coffee, these grinders will work quickly at the flick of a switch and give you freshly-ground peanut butter. It's pretty much the best and the easiest way to get it.

If you have thick, full eyebrows, you might need to tweeze them; if you have thin, small eyebrows, you may need to fill them in with a pencil. Either way, here is how to find a shape that's flattering to any face.","Eyebrows frame the face and are an important part of how we express emotions. Because of this, subtle changes to their shape and color can drastically impact someone's look. Whatever your reason for drawing on your eyebrows, there many different techniques you can use to achieve the perfect look!","Using a razor to shape your eyebrows can give you the same look as waxing or tweezing, but without the pain.

Whether you're going for a drag look, creating a costume for Halloween, or just spicing up your usual appearance, covering your eyebrows is relatively simple. By using a spirit gum, foundation and powder, you can complete obscure your eyebrows.","Since eyebrows frame your eyes, many people like to shape them to improve their look. As a result, eyebrows can accumulate dandruff, oil, dirt, and makeup. Gently cleaning your eyebrows will ensure they stay fresh. You can clean your eyebrows using face wash or other products like tea tree oil or a brow serum. You can then maintain your eyebrows so they look their best.","If plucking your eyebrows isn't something you like to do or aren't good at, there are several other ways you can easily get a better shaped brow. The shape of the eyebrows has a major effect on your overall facial appearance, so you should never neglect your brows.","Eyebrows are an important facial feature because they help express emotions and frame your face. Short eyebrows can sometimes make your face look wider than it really is. If you want to extend the edges (or ""tails"") of your eyebrows immediately, use makeup to fill them in. For a more permanent result, let your eyebrows grow out for 6 to 8 weeks and then reshape them to appear longer. You can also apply serums and other products to stimulate hair growth.","The shape of your face can affect which hairstyles, glasses, or makeup effects look best on you. To determine your face shape, start by getting familiar with the basic shape categories. Identify your face shape with a few measurements, and use your new-found knowledge to help you pick hairstyles, makeup styles, and accessories that flatter your face.","2","2","3","1","1","4","2","1","1","2","4","3"

Drinking plenty of water can help you shed water weight by keeping your fluid levels in balance. Women should drink at least 2.7 L (0.71 US gal) of water every day. Avoid drinks that can dehydrate you, like alcohol.","Gaining weight is a fairly common (and annoying) side effect of some methods of birth control. If you find yourself packing on the pounds after starting a new birth control routine, you might need to take some action. You can try exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet to help minimize the water weight your body may be retaining. You can also try talking to your doctor about your symptoms, or even switching to another form of birth control with fewer hormonal side effects.","Drinking more water is an excellent goal for your overall health because your body needs water to function properly. Water is also a calorie-free alternative to other beverages, so drinking more water can help you to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Be on the lookout for ways to remember to drink more water. You can also increase your motivation to drink more water by improving its flavor. To keep yourself on track, set goals for yourself to drink more water every day.","","Are you looking to maximize every paycheck and squeeze as much as you can out of your income? With a few adjustments to your lifestyle and your finances, you'll be able to increase the amount of money you bring in every month and maintain a healthy income.","If your shower gives you a trickle of water that doesn’t rinse off the soap on your body, you may be dealing with low water pressure. It’s a frustrating problem, but it’s one that is often easy to fix. The water pressure you receive depends on a couple of factors, including your home’s location and plumbing. Check your showerhead and home plumbing first. If the pressure is continually low, you may need to contact your utility provider or even install a pressure booster. No matter the problem, you will soon be able to enjoy a relaxing shower once again.","When you become pregnant, your uterus will form an amniotic sac that will produce amniotic fluid. This fluid acts as protection for your baby while he or she is in your uterus. Oligohydramnios is a condition that can develop where your amniotic fluid levels decrease. This can cause problems for your pregnancy, so it is very important that you bring your fluid levels back up through both medical and at-home intervention.","The demand for water has recently increased surpassing supply. This is as a result of industries (Construction, Manufacturing, Cleaning) sprouting fortnight, climatic changes, and poor methods of harvesting water. Therefore, sustainable solutions need to be embraced so as to mitigate this serious issue to ensure optimal availability of water to use in our daily activities. Water collection can be enhanced in two scenarios: as a government initiative and on an individual basis.","","A toilet with a weak flush can be a major cause of frustration. If it regularly takes you two or more flushes to accomplish what a single flush should, it may be time to address the problem at its source—inside the tank. Making sure everything is up to standard will go a long way toward keeping your toilet in good working order and avoiding expensive performance issues. The first thing you should take a look at is the water level inside the tank. Assuming this is where it needs to be, you can start diagnosing other possible factors in low water power, such as clogged siphon jets or a leaky flush valve.","Siphoning is a great way of using gravity to move large amounts of water from one location to another. You can empty a pool, clean a fish tank, or prepare rainwater jugs by siphoning. If you are working with fresh water, it’s possible to move water through a siphon using pressure from your mouth. If you are working with a single siphon tube, submerging the tube and draining it is a quick option. However, if you are tackling a larger job, then a two-hose siphon system might be your best bet.","Increasing your water pressure often seems like a daunting chore. There are many causes of low water pressure, yet many surprisingly simple remedies that you can perform yourself. To increase water pressure, decide if you need to only increase pressure at one faucet, fix a broad yet recent low pressure problem, or address a history of low pressure. The exact solution will vary depending on the issue you're dealing with.","By the time you reach the end of your pregnancy, you might be really anxious for it to be over. It makes sense that you're ready to meet your new baby! Your water breaking is a sign that you're either in labor or about to be. If you are full term (or overdue), you might want to encourage labor to begin. There are many natural methods to try, but you should be aware that they are not backed by science. Before trying to encourage your water to break, talk to your doctor. You might also need to have a doctor break your water for you.","A well water system requires an open source of water coming from the water main, proper pressure readings in the control system, and an adequate amount of air in the well’s pressure tank. To diagnose problems with pressure, you’ll need to drain the system, measure the pressure in the tank, and check your control unit in order to solve the problem—either by adding air to the tank or by adjusting a setting on your control unit. If the system is working as intended, check the feed from the water main. If all else fails, you can always install a pressure booster to artificially increase pressure in your water lines.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

Asking others for help can strengthen bonds and also help friends or family members feel more competent. We often mistakenly assume that asking for help makes us look weak, or underestimate others’ desire to help. Think about a few tasks with which you could use assistance. Recount offers for help you have received in the past. Match your specific needs to the abilities or interests of those who have offered help. For example, if you have a friend who loves baking, and you could use help planning a party, she would probably be thrilled to help. Finally, be direct. Requests for help often go unmet when they are ambiguous.

While pine isn’t tough to paint, it comes with a problem called color bleeding. This is an issue especially with knotty pine since the knots leak more resin, leaving a stain. To deal with this, take plenty of time to prepare the wood, filling in gaps and sanding it. Then, choose a quality primer and paint, such as oil-based shellac. If you deal with the potential for stains, painting is a simple and affordable way to redecorate pine.","Maybe you’re a new parent overwhelmed by keeping the house in order.

Purchase or rent a manual ratcheting pipe threader and use it to thread piping yourself. If you are planning to do a lot of pipe threading or have a plumbing business, there are also hand-held power threaders and threading machines that you could use. However, these types of automatic threaders are very expensive and not practical for simple home use when an affordable ratcheting pipe threader can get the job done just as well.","When you have a crush on someone, you're giddy with hope for the future — and it's heartbreaking when you realize it won't work out. Maybe your crush is seeing someone else, or you just know that getting together is impossible. Letting go and moving on is a process, but if you're really determined to put your crush behind you and to move on, you can do it.","","Knowing the size of your pipe threads is essential for connecting pipes so they have a tight seal. While measuring pipe threads may seem confusing, it’s actually relatively easy to do because the size of the pipe and its thread size are measured according to the same scale. First, you need to identify whether you have a male or female pipe. A male pipe has the threads on the outside of it, while a female pipe has the threads inside of it. Take a few simple measurements so you compare them to find your pipe thread size.","Spaghetti squash is a tasty and healthy alternative to pasta, but cutting into it can be a challenge. Spaghetti squash has tough skin and delicate flesh, making it hard to slice without hurting yourself or the fragile strands within. You don't have to dread cutting spaghetti squash, though. Softening the skin in the microwave or in the oven before you cut makes it much easier to get to the pasta-like strands inside.","Tatting threads are specialized; they need to be strong, smooth, of a good sheen and easy to work with. This article provides some tips on choosing tatting threads.","Spaghetti squash is a healthy alternative to pasta, and it's easy to make. Roasting your spaghetti squash in the oven will give you the best flavor, but you can also cook it in the microwave if you're in a rush.

Use a blowtorch or similar welding tool and weld along the corners of the rectangle. Weld all the areas you can reach first. Then let the metal cool down and flip it over so you can reach the bottom. Make sure there are no openings or holes in your weld spots. This keeps water out and prevents rusting. You can rent welding equipment from hardware stores, or buy it if you prefer. Wear a welding mask, thick gloves, and a leather apron while you weld. Never touch metal right after you welded it. Wait for everything to cool down first.","A trailer is a type of cart that hitches to the back of a vehicle and is used to transport large items like furniture, lumber, landscaping equipment, and more. There are many trailer types, but a common dimension for everyday needs is 6 feet (1.8 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m). This is sturdy enough for most household items but too small to haul vehicles. To build this trailer, construct the bed out of rectangular metal tubing from a hardware store. Weld these pieces together. Then build the cage and tailgate with metal pipe. Finally, install the axle and wheels to complete your trailer.","Welding is the process of using electrical current to superheat and melt metal so that you can join two pieces of metal together. There are several ways to weld, but the two most popular ways to weld at home include gas metal arc welding, or MIG welding, and arc welding, otherwise known as stick welding. While welding can seem intimidating at first, it's actually fairly simple once you take the proper safety precautions and practice using your welding machine.","","Welding is the process of using electrical current to superheat and melt metal so that you can join two pieces of metal together.

You should not attempt it on the strength of reading a brief Internet article, no matter how informative. However, understanding the basics can help you prepare for a qualification course, or to make better decisions for welding projects run by qualified personnel under your supervision.","Now that you have yourself a Buzz Box, you are probably anxious to see what this little arc welder can do. Your first attempt at welding may seem like you wasted a lot of time and money acquiring a piece of crap that clearly doesn't work. Rest assured, you have a welding machine that is capable of producing quality welds with the right welding electrodes and a little help from you.","Whether you need to repair a crack or join pieces of plastic together, welding is the solution. Welding is a relatively simple task to do at home since plastic is so soft and pliable. You need an electric welding gun and an appropriate welding rod to complete the repair. After you clean and identify the plastic, use the heat of the gun to gradually melt and join the plastic together. Finish the weld by smoothing it out to create a fix that is stronger and cheaper than a new piece of plastic.","Want to add a little uniqueness to your outdoor garden area?  Instead of using a wooden or pre-made garden border, repurpose a set of broken plate pieces to line your greenery.","Lead is a waterproof metal that melts easily and is less prone to corrosion, making it an ideal choice for many welding projects. Although lead is often used for automobile parts and pipes, it is highly toxic when handled improperly. Take precautions by ventilating the area and wearing safety gear before turning on your torch. Then, use an oxyacetylene torch and a rod of lead solder to complete the bond. Whether you work with old or new pieces of lead, weld them to create a strong, long-lasting bond.","Learning the basics of torch welding is the first step in becoming proficient with many types of welding. However, mastering welding is something that can take time, not necessarily due to its difficulty, but because there are many subtleties involved with maneuvering the torch. There are many types of materials that can be welded, and each has its own unique properties. Once you've mastered the oxygen flow and tip size on a torch, you will be ready to practice handling the torch and apply the process to a variety of projects. Use these tips to learn how to torch weld.","Copper and its alloys are widely used in construction, especially in the electrical and plumbing trades. Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity and has a high resistance to corrosion and wear. These unique assets also offer unique challenges. Working with copper, especially welding copper, requires its own special techniques. Before working with copper, learn to handle it safely by taking proper precautions, identifying alloys and thickness.","Spot welding uses the heat from an electrical current to join 2 pieces of metal quickly, and is typically used for joining sheet metal. It’s also easy to do with a spot welding machine, which has 2 electrode tongs about 6 inches (15 cm) long that pass an electrical current through the metal to fuse them together. Connect the metal you want to weld together and put on a pair of welding gloves and goggles to be safe. Then, turn on the machine, move the pieces of metal between the 2 electrode tongs, and hold down the switch to press the tongs to the metal weld them together.","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

Again, it's deeply embedded in our psyche to approach things via mind (thoughts, reactions and emotions), that sometimes even before the mental reaction becomes thought, you have already acted in form of words or action that arise out of mental conditioning. So be highly alert by being in touch with aliveness of inner-body to detect deep seated mental patterns. There could be a conflict between polarizing thoughts about forcing and being in the body naturally, which are both mental positions. If that happens, allow or accept them to be. You are the seeing, not the condition or thoughts that are seen. If you simply offer no inner opposition or resistance to whatever arises, it dissolves naturally without any effort. That's the power and miracle of surrender. Its the effort or opposition or 'will' that gives the mind renewed strength.","","","","Looking for inner happiness and peace? Inner peace means you have a sense of harmony, emotional well-being and fulfillment in your life despite your current struggles (money, relationships, loss, etc). You can achieve this by practicing acceptance of yourself and the world around you, engaging in mindfulness, and meditation.","Some people are confused about the many benefits that homeschooling provides.  To overcome their opposition, begin by explaining that homeschooling is a great solution to the dubious quality of traditional public school education.

Another major concern for homeschooling skeptics is a perceived lack of social interaction for homeschooled youth.  Explain to these skeptics that there are many opportunities outside of school for social interaction, and that homeschooling offers numerous practical benefits for families and communities.","Your inner self is inside you and it should not be a hard thing to find it. Remember that everyone has something in them than can make the whole world grovel at their feet. You just have to find that something and it is 100% inside you.","An internal bath cleanses the colon and rids the body of toxins. By learning how to take an internal bath, you can reap the health benefits of this alternative healing modality and help keep your body's toxicity levels at a minimum. Also known as colon cleansing or detoxification, internal baths additionally help the body expel undigested food and waste products that sit in the colon.","Have you made an offer on a home only to have it rejected with the return of a counteroffer? This is a very common occurrence in the real estate market. The seller might counter with a higher price, might reject or modify some of your conditions, or both. If you feel the counteroffer is fair, you can accept it and proceed with the purchase of the property. If you do not agree with the terms of the counteroffer, you can reject the offer outright or reject the terms of the counteroffer with a new counteroffer of your own.","Citing your research is an important part of any paper, and you should know how to properly use internal citations (also known as parenthetical citations) in your work. If you use direct quotes, paraphrase another’s work, or summarize another’s views, you must document this in your paper through the use of internal citations. The Modern Language Association (MLA) and American Psychological Association (APA) citation styles are two of the most common; others common styles will follow the same general rules, but you should refer to their specific style guides for more detailed guidance.","","Applying for an internal job can be a lot harder and fraught with worries than applying for an external one because everyone involved already knows you. It can feel as if you are exposing yourself by having to sell yourself to people who already work with you. Although great if you get the internal position, what happens when you don't? It can be a bit of an ego-hit and can leave you continuing to feel exposed and uncomfortable around those who were involved. Here is how to ride it out.","","Figuring out who you are and your place in the world is a life-long task. But it doesn't have to be scary or intimidating. Once you realize that finding yourself is an ongoing process, not some sort of goal you must attain, you'll realize that you know much more about your inner self than you ever imagined.","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","4","3","1","2","0"

However, you cannot force someone to quit, and the decision to do so is ultimately his responsibility.","Smoking is an undeniably hard habit to quit, but you’re making a great choice by putting the tobacco down. Not only will you feel better physically when you quit, but you’ll lower your risk dramatically for heart disease, lung cancer, and other health problems. While nicotine replacement can be effective, many people chose to opt for a more natural approach. Quitting is hard, but your chances of being successful go up exponentially if you prepare to quit, find a way to suppress the urges, and make a few lifestyle changes to deter yourself from smoking. While you can quit nicotine without medical assistance, you do need to contact a doctor if you experience severe withdrawal.","Quitting smoking is a difficult and time consuming endeavor. It takes considerable willpower and a deep commitment to achieve your goal of being smoke-free. There are multiple strategies for breaking your addiction to smoking; however, there is no single way to quit and individual success rates will not be the same for everyone. Although ending your smoking habit will not happen instantly, you can make it a little less difficult by creating a plan and following through on it utilizing different methods to curb your guilty cravings.","Drinking and smoking go hand in hand for some people, and quitting both at the same time can be difficult. Recovery should be about experiencing freedom, and quitting alcohol and tobacco together means a deeper sense of personal freedom and a commitment to living addiction-free.","","Understanding the risks of smoking and then making the decision to quit are the most positive and powerful steps a cigarette smoker can take. Once you’ve made that decision, however, it takes effort to remain smoke-free. Knowing how nicotine addiction works and how to prevent setbacks will allow you to fight back against the inevitable cravings that follow a decision to stop smoking. The first days and weeks without cigarettes are the hardest, but it does get easier with time. Stick with it!","3","1","4","1","3","4","1","4","2","3","0","4"

Identify the source of your fear. Oftentimes, your fear may be as simple as worrying about how silly you look, but sometimes, you might have a frightening image at a young age and turn off your clairvoyant abilities in response. Get rid of your fear by chanting an affirmative phrase silently or out loud. Try a phrase like, ""I am willing to release all fear of seeing my future.""","Clairvoyance is the ability to “see” the future, but true clairvoyance does not require crystal balls and elaborate fortune telling rituals. Before developing your clairvoyance, work on developing your natural intuitive abilities. Once these have been fine-tuned, exercise your mind's ability to tap into the sights, sounds, feelings, and overall energy flowing around you. Keep reading to learn more about the process.","Everyone experiences fear sometimes. Fear can actually help keep you safe by alerting you to potentially dangerous situations. However, there are times when fear runs amok and disrupts your daily life. Fortunately, there are things you can do to address your fears and minimize the impact it has on you.","Mangoes are tropical fruits that are enjoyed all over the world. Whether you're eating the mango by itself or putting it in a salad or a main course, you need to peel it correctly first. Follow these steps for peeling a mango in  a few easy ways.","If you don't make it your business to overcome fear, you'd better believe it'll try to overcome you. Fear in this article is defined as the emotional response to danger, no matter whether it's perceived or real, and the subsequent biological, or physical responses that harm your well-being and reinforce general emotional unhappiness. What underscores fear in all its permutations is the feeling that you won't be all right. Whether it's the ghost that you think appears in your room or your boss firing you; just ask yourself is my fear real? Or is it just my imagination. You can lessen these feelings by harnessing your biological reactions and trying to minimize them, or even retraining them.","","The thought of losing your job can be really scary.  How will you support your family or your lifestyle if you don’t have a source of income?  Unfortunately, being afraid of losing your job can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The fear of being let go by your employer can decrease your productivity and paralyze you from taking strides at work.  If you want to perform at your potential, you’ll have to drop your fear of being fired.","Fear is a very common emotion that people young and old can experience, but it can be more intense for children. Your child might be scared because of an unfamiliar situation, an active imagination, or revisiting a previous bad experience. However, you can help your child overcome their fears by being supportive and empathetic.","Having a fear of love can be a difficult thing to overcome. Whether you have been hurt in the past by a bad relationship or simply have a fear of the unknown, fearing love and intimacy can be hard to cope with. There are self-reflection techniques and concrete steps you can take to help end your fear of love.","It's easy to ignore our fears and hope that they'll just go away. Unfortunately, they rarely do. If you don't face your fears, they'll end up controlling you. How do you face them? The most common way to face your fears is through exposure, where you gradually face the thing or situation you're afraid of. With the right method of thinking, you'll wonder why you weren't doing it sooner!","Being afraid of the dark is a common fear for children. As a parent, it is important that you provide reassurance to their fears and communicate that you understand their concerns.  Teach your child that they are safe in the dark.  Use coping strategies for children to help them feel comfortable when they are alone at night. By making the bedtime routine something fun and relaxing, sleeping in the dark will seem less scary.","We all experience anxiety from time to time. In small doses, anxiety can be a good thing because it helps you realize when things aren't right. However, stressors can accumulate over time to cause a permanent state of anxiety that requires retraining your mind. Feelings of fear and concern that something bad may happen can penetrate day to day life, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the present moment. Sometimes anxiety passes when its source fades away, but for many people it lingers, taking the joy out of life. Taking measures to form new mental and physical habits is the first step toward getting relief.","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

Typically, fuse boxes are located in basements, garages, laundry rooms, and attics.If you have trouble finding your fuse box, check the utility meter outside your home. Try to follow the wire that leads from the meter. Fuse boxes and circuit breakers are usually located near where power enters the house. Older homes have glass fuses that look like light bulbs. When fuses blow, they need to be replaced. Newer homes, on the other hand, have circuit breakers instead, which just need to be flipped and reset.","A blown fuse can be annoying, but it actually helps prevent electrical damage and fire. Fortunately, fuses are inexpensive and easy to replace. If the power’s out in your home or car, you should be able to check the fuses simply by looking at them. Look inside the fuse in question for black charred marks or a broken filament wire. If you can’t see any obvious signs, you can always use a test light or multimeter to figure out if the fuse is working properly.","While it is not a common occurrence, every once in a while you may have to replace a fuse or reset a breaker.

Fear not, here are some suggestions and ideas that will help you turn that sunken treasure into gold.","Spring is the perfect time to organize your garage.

Rejection doesn't feel great and sometimes it feels unfathomable but it shouldn't be something you permit to take away happiness from your life. The reality of life is that rejection will form a part of it––there will be occasions when your job application, your date request or your ideas for change will be rejected by someone, somewhere. It is a healthy attitude to accept that rejection is a part of life and to acknowledge that what really matters is finding the way to bounce back and try again.","Many people want to get in shape and improve their health but have a difficult time maintaining a regimen that works for them.

And you’re not being selfish telling someone no. If you have too many things on your plate any one day, don’t allow yourself to add more. Focus on your priorities — Review all the things you have on your plate and evaluate if any new things you’ve been asked to do fit with your top priorities or are more important. If the things you’ve been asked to do are a low priority in your life right now, it’s probably a good idea to say no. If your friend asks if you can help him with his resume today, but you're taking your dad to the hospital for some tests, you can say, ""You know, I really can't today."" Be realistic — Think realistically about what you can accomplish in a given day. Not only that, but what can you accomplish effectively? Maybe you can tackle 20 tasks in a day, but will you be able to do them well? Maybe adding one or two more things into the mix will hurt the quality of all your tasks for that day, because you're scrambling to do everything. Don't forget, at some point you need to eat and sleep to take care of yourself. Eliminate guilt — Don’t agree to do something simply because saying no will make you feel guilty. It’s entirely possible that the person asking this of you is hoping you’ll feel guilty and say yes. If you are feeling guilty, think about all the times you have agreed to help people in the past. Remember that you can't please everyone all of the time; you can't say ""yes"" to everything, as much as you might want to. If someone gets mad at you for saying you can't do something, you may need to examine whether or not that person really cares about your wellbeing. Take your time — Don’t say yes or no immediately. Tell the person asking you to do something that you need time to think about it. Then actually take that time. Sleep on it, think about it, and then make a final decision when you aren’t rushed.","We, as humans, often find ourselves making the effort to take care of others, like our children, spouse, friends, parents, grandparents, and so on. Yet we rarely take the time to be good to ourselves. Taking care of ourselves is essential to living a long, happy, and healthy life. There are many things, big and small, that we can do for ourselves on a regular basis to relax, recharge, reflect, and reevaluate.","Many people struggle with saying, ""No."" If someone asks you for a favor or a commitment, you may feel obligated to say ""Yes."" Remember, just because you can do something does not mean it is required. Work on considering the best ways to say ""No."" Think about things like your personal boundaries and the situation at hand. When saying ""No,"" do so in a polite manner that makes your boundaries clear. Work on avoiding guilt after saying ""No."" Understand you always have a right to turn down an invitation or refuse a favor. It's okay to make yourself and your mental health a priority.","If you are looking to conserve space in a suitcase or drawer, consider rolling your items instead of folding them. When you are rolling clothing, it is imperative that you smooth out wrinkles as you fold and roll the item. Avoid rolling clothing made of delicate and/or stiff material—rolling these items may damage and wrinkle the material.","Teaching students the parts of speech might seem like a daunting task. But with a little creativity on your part, it can actually be fun for both you and you and your students. Start by giving your students a clear overview of what nouns are and why they are important. Then, use a variety of activities and games to help your students get a better grasp of the subject. Typically, students learn about nouns early in elementary school. However, you can adjust any of these activities to be helpful for middle-schoolers, too.","Ever wish you could be proficient in a second, or third or even fourth language?  It won't be easy, but it is possible and extremely rewarding to know and be fluent in many languages. There are several aspects to learning a language: listening skills, speaking skills, writing skills and reading skills. All are equally important, so try not to lag behind in any one category. You can join a class, hire a private tutor, or try to learn at home. The more work you put in, the more you will improve.","","Loving another person can seem like a daunting or even scary thing. Whether that person is your friend, a family member, or boyfriend/girlfriend, love means each of you are vulnerable to each other, and you may be wondering how you can do that. Start with working on trusting people. Try working on trusting other people. You also need to be able to express your thoughts and feelings to the other person through honest communication and affectionate behavior.","Learning a foreign language can be difficult, but if you follow certain techniques, soon you'll be able to learn any language. Although there's no easy way to go about it, with some hard work and practice, you can be fluent in no time.","Learning can be a pretty personal thing -- different techniques tend to work for different people, and you may find that the strategies that have helped you understand one kind of topic may not be as effective for another. That's completely normal, so don't worry! There's a lot of contradictory advice out there, but there are also plenty of tried-and-true approaches supported by the kinds of organizations that would know best, such as university learning centers. Those techniques are definitely the best places to start, so we've done the research for you and collected all the best advice here. With a little persistence, you'll likely be able to improve your focus and absorb information more effectively.","Many people struggle with saying, ""No."" If someone asks you for a favor or a commitment, you may feel obligated to say ""Yes.""

Learning this skill can help keep you safe and allow you to build and maintain strong and healthy relationships. It can also help you learn to identify and take the best opportunities that come your way, and to ignore those that are a waste of your time and talents. In order to know when to say ""no,"" it is important to learn more about your personal limits as well as to understand how to identify opportunities that are too good to be true.","It's okay to say no. There are many reasons why we should say no sometimes, and there are just as many reasons why we don't – and suffer for not doing so. Read the steps below to understand why it's hard to say no, and how you can learn to do it without feeling guilty.","Sometimes, saying no to yourself is harder than saying it to others. You might feel that you 'owe it to yourself' or 'Why not', or some other excuse. This can lead to spending way too much money, too much weight and having just too much stuff in your house.","3","2","3","2","4","4","1","3","3","2","1","0"

With over 1.3 million apps already and counting, your app in the App Store is more like trying to find a needle in haystack. And, making the situation even worse is, obviously, the old school search engines. Your app is at the mercy of keywords fields and the presence of keywords in your app name to be found.

While the petition may be a less used avenue to address political leaders, it provides and important way for everyday people to make their voices heard and to ask elected officials to take action. If you feel passionate about an issue, the petition is a low-cost way for you to take a stand for change in your community.

Return your fork to your plate. Fully engage your senses as you chew at least 20 times per bite. Pick up your fork and take another bite, repeating the process. Avoid talking or any sort of entertainment while eating. Ground yourself completely in the act of eating.","Times of extreme stress or insecurity, like starting a new job or adjusting to change in your home environment, can cause you to feel disconnected from yourself.

This comes about through comparing yourself to others and finding yourself wanting in certain ways. This is a slippery slope to tread, where your thinking will only become more and more negative. You can always see the appearances others wish to portray publicly but you won't ever see what's really going on behind their facades in their apparently perfect world. By comparing yourself to others, you give their image-portrayal way too much power and reduce your own worth based on a mirage. It's a useless activity that only brings harm. Instead, value the person you are, love your personality, and embrace your flaws; we all have them, and as explained earlier, being honest is better than running from them.","""Be yourself"" is quite possibly the most commonly used phrase in the history of individualist-based advice. Be yourself. It's such a vague adage. What does it really mean, to be yourself? And is it really as easy as it sounds? With the steps below, it can be.","It’s tough not to compare yourself with others, given the preoccupation we have with perfection in modern life. If we start examining our achievements and accomplishments, then we can raise the bar even further. It is natural to compare yourself to others, and even envy them. But when you become obsessed with your deficiencies, rather than the areas in which you excel, you are focused on the wrong thing.  This can be debilitating, and it can even prevent you from taking part in many aspects of your life. Constant comparison with others tends to lower your self-esteem and make you feel bad about yourself.  Resist the urge to compare yourself with others by becoming aware of how you view yourself. Set goals for yourself that will build your confidence, and relearn behaviors that will improve your opinion of yourself.","Making conversation can be difficult. Sometimes you feel shy, or maybe you don't have much in common with the person you're talking to. Learning to become a good conversationalist is not as difficult as you may imagine, but it does require some practice. Whether it's at a dinner party, at your school, or over the phone, good conversations start when 2 or more people feel comfortable talking with each other. There are several steps you can take to learn to relax and have a great conversation with practically anybody.","You may not know, but you should always be yourself, even when you're trying to impress everyone. This can be hanging out with many people or dressing to show who you are. Need some help? Read below on how to do so.","Whether it comes easy to you or you struggle chasing it, rest is sacred to everyone. We all need rest. It’s one of the fundamental needs of the human body. Still, many people often feel overworked and exhausted. There are ways to help make the rest that you do get feel more restful, but resting isn’t only about sleeping. Remember, your mind and your body both get tired.","It’s tough not to compare yourself with others, given the preoccupation we have with perfection in modern life.

Set goals for yourself that will build your confidence, and relearn behaviors that will improve your opinion of yourself.","Dealing with hatred from others can be difficult and draining. Especially if someone is openly hateful toward you, it can make you feel bad about yourself and affect your self-esteem.  Be positive in your approach and cope with your stress and emotions. Make any necessary changes to get along better with others and smooth any problems.","Compare and contrast essays are often assigned to students because they promote critical thinking, analytical reasoning and organized writing. A compare and contrast essay should look at a subject in a new way, with fresh insight, using the similarities and the differences between two topics or two perspectives on one topic.","If you see someone being harassed, bullied, or discriminated against, you may know it's wrong, but be unsure how you can intervene and support the victim. Standing up for someone else can feel scary, and many people are reluctant to step in, but know that one voice can make a difference. You can intervene in a situation by speaking to the victim and diffusing the confrontation, and supporting the victim after the incident. You can also take measures to prevent bullying and harassment in your own school or community.","Comparing two proportions is often necessary to see if they are significantly different from each other. For example, suppose you do a randomized control study on 40 people, half assigned to a treatment and other half assigned to a placebo. 18/20 from the experiment group got better, while 15/20 from the control group also got better. Are these two proportions significantly different from each other? Is the treatment effective? Once you know how to compare proportions, you'll be able to answer those questions.","There are a lot of different people in the world, but despite our differences we all want to get along. Humans are social beings, and we enjoy being treated nicely. Getting along with someone, regardless of their passions, isn't about being their best friend or sharing all their hobbies. It is about treating people with respect and care.","Whether you have a headache, are healing after surgery, are studying, or trying to read a magazine, everyone needs peace and quiet at times. Given certain circumstances, even low levels of unwanted noise can cause extreme reactions. Each situation calls for a slightly different approach, which will produce the peace and quiet you desire.","","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4"

Your hard disk thus becomes bloated with unused or unwanted programs or apps. This will slow down your computer, so if you have programs and apps installed on your device that you no longer want or no longer use, it is better to uninstall them to free up disk space for newer and more useful programs and apps you may want.","Loving your body can be difficult, especially with photoshopped media images constantly barraging us on a day to day basis. The glamour shots and models seen in magazines and billboards are false representations of what those people actually look like, but somehow it can be easy to feel expected to live up to those standards. There is no such thing as a perfect body, and trying to achieve one is impossible. Everyone has their own unique shape that should be embraced and not criticized. Your body is part of what has taken you through life, and that is something to love.","","Stretching correctly will increase your flexibility and reduce your risk of injuries when exercising or going about your daily life.

Making dietary changes, trying a fast, exercising more and living a chemical-free lifestyle are all effective ways to cleanse the body.

If you have food to eat and a roof over your head, your money has accomplished the bulk of what it can do to contribute to your happiness. Be thankful that we are more fortunate than our hunter-gatherer ancestors who had to struggle for essentials to stay alive, eat whenever possible, and worry about the possibility of being able to survive 'til the next day.","Is money a tool in a growing garden of good things or a trap in a snarled, tangled weed patch. Here's how to spend your time -- life -- well.","Remaining contented throughout your life is a big task but an important one. Contented people have fewer health issues, are more likely to enjoy life to its fullest and do not want for what they do not have. A contented person is not chasing after rainbows or trying to keep up with the Joneses; instead, a contented person knows that the source of contentment is deep within, trusting oneself and loving the life one has.","","Happiness is a great goal to have, and it’s something you’ll need to work toward every day. Being happy isn’t something you achieve and then hold onto — it’s a series of decisions that you make every day. Start by cultivating positivity in your life and living your life in a way that feels right to you. Additionally, spend time with positive people, connect with others, and support a healthy body and mind. However, keep in mind that mental illnesses like depression can make it hard to be happy without treatment from a mental health provider.","Content Lock is a mobile device feature that prevents minors under the age of 18 from accessing and viewing adult content. The Content Lock feature is enforced and regulated by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), and is enabled on all mobile devices that operate under EE and its brands, including Orange and T-Mobile.","It’s easy to wish you looked like or acted like someone else, or had the cushy job or great boyfriend that someone else has. No matter who you are, you can learn to be happy and fulfilled with your life.  Take time to appreciate your talents and characteristics while forming a healthy body image and self-esteem. Focus on the positive aspects of your job, hobbies, and lifestyle. Fostering strong and close relationships can help you feel more satisfied and confident in your lifestyle.","Content marketing is different from traditional advertising because it does not directly promote the products or services your business offers. Instead, it involves developing and distributing informative content—such as blog posts, articles, and infographics—that is relevant to the needs of your customers. If you want to incorporate content marketing into your business strategy, start by creating a plan for building and distributing your content. Identify the needs of your clients so that you can target your content directly to them. Once you create some high-quality content, you’ll need to distribute and promote it so that it reaches your audience effectively.","Once upon a time, people used to just shake the container of alcohol and look at the bubbles to tell the alcohol content. Nowadays, it’s even easier. You can use a specialized hydrometer called an alcohol meter that is calibrated to calculate the proof of a liquid. You can also use a distiller’s parrot to measure the alcohol content of a liquid.","We've all had the feeling before. You know that you have everything to be thankful for: a great significant other, a loving family, a pretty good job, and a healthy working body. Still, you keep having this nagging feeling that what you have just isn't enough. Sure, you can be happier by making some life changes, but the easiest way to be content with your life is to adjust your perspective and daily actions, which will make you more likely to appreciate what you have. So how do you start enjoying that sunshine instead of complaining about sunburn? Follow these steps.","In our fast-paced, interconnected modern world, it's hard not to constantly want something new, something better, something faster.  Whether it's your car, your house, or your family, we're always looking for ways to trade up, always chasing the next best thing.  But this cycle of pursuit and temporary satisfaction is never-ending.  To free yourself from it, you must eventually become content with what you have.  This doesn't mean you never seek improvements within yourself or your quality of life, but it does mean to stay conscious of how lucky you really are, and finding simple joys in everyday moments.","The Table of Contents in a document acts as a map for the reader, making it easier for them to find information in the document based on title and page number. A good Table of Contents should be organized, easy to read and simple to use. You can write a Table of Contents manually on your computer or have a word processing tool create it for you. Make sure the Table of Contents is formatted properly in your final document so it is as accurate and accessible as possible.","Remaining contented throughout your life is a big task but an important one.

There’s a lot of pressure to have the perfect relationships, the most expensive material items, and a life that appears to be in order. However, there truly are so many things to be grateful for in your unique day-to-day life.

Colors can also improve your mood, and wearing colors that are a bit trendy can help you look current. Experiment with different colors, and find the ones that suit you best. A good color should make your skin look healthy, not pale, blotchy, or sickly. Your eyes look clear and bright, not bloodshot or tired. If you have blue or green eyes, try wearing a blue shirt or tie to bring them out. Also, certain shades of red or brown might “cancel out” your eye color and make you look tired. If you have fair skin and dark hair, you might consider wearing clothes that complement this contrast. Wearing a lot of tans or khakis might make you look “washed out.”  The colors you wear should make you feel happy and at ease. Pay attention to how the colors you wear make you feel. Also, if you’re not comfortable wearing a particular color, don’t wear it, even if it‘s trendy or the color of your favorite team.

Some colors are considered classic and never go out of style, such as brown, black, khaki, gray, and navy blue. These are great colors to use, but again, consider your skin tone and how you feel while wearing them. Buy the pieces you wear everyday and expensive pieces in these colors. That way they will be versatile and you can wear them for a long time. Remember that even though these colors are “neutral” they can still be either flattering or unflattering on you. For example, black looks too severe on some people.","By dressing well, guys can give off the appearance of being confident, attractive, put-together men that any firm would want to hire and anyone would want to date.

You are a unique person, and with some effort, you can find your path. Identify people in your life that are positive and caring. Spend more time with them. Learn the difference between people who annoy or hurt you versus people who may come across as negative because they are telling you to be cautious. Not all criticism is bad, so think before you discredit someone's point. Trust your own judgment if negativity seems to dominate a conversation. Some people may want you to fail because it makes their life easier, or because they are struggling and want things to be difficult for other people, too. Be strong and be positive.","Wishing you were more independent, with a life of your own?  Getting your life started requires discipline and determination.  As a teen, you may feel like you just want to get away from your family and school.  It can be tough at times to be independent, but also very rewarding if done right.  Consider the ways you can get your life on track.","Being around negative people can drain your energy and cause you to feel trapped and overwhelmed.

Once you master braiding, you can move on to more intricate braids, such as the French braid and fishtail braid.","Negative people can be harmful to your state of mind and your sense of self. You can avoid getting sucked down by negative people in your life by first identifying them and then by taking steps to create distance and space from them.","To prevent negative people from hurting your self-confidence, you need to understand that their negativity is more a reflection of them, and not a reflection of you. When someone is attacking you with negativity, do not retaliate. Instead, remain positive and imagine their negativity bouncing off of you and back to them. If you find that their negativity is bringing down your self-esteem, then re-build it by replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts. If this doesn't work, then make sure to find professional support, or support from outside friends or family members.","A conflict has occurred between you and another person and now you want, or need, to avoid him/her. The reasons for your disdain can range from minor annoyances to life threatening circumstances. When left to manage conflict in close proximity to someone you dislike, avoidance can prevent worsening the current situation and averting future disputes. Managing this in your on-line world, at school, work, and within your family requires practical strategies that can be learned, if you don’t avoid the call to action.","Are you looking for ways to avoid strangers?  Are you bothered by a friend or acquaintance who acts strange around you?  We all have been in situations where you suddenly become uncomfortable and you feel like you need to leave.  Don't become trapped in a situation you can't control; pay attention to your ""spidey sense"" and learn how to avoid strange people.","It can be difficult to avoid people, particularly when those people are seeking out your company. However, there are steps that you can take to make yourself unavailable, whether you want to avoid a specific person or you just need a break from people in general. Understand the reasons why you want to avoid people, and bear in mind that you may not be able to avoid people forever.","Is there a pessimist in your life – a person who thinks about the negative aspects of a situation more than the positive? If you are someone who is optimistic and cheerful, it may be difficult to understand and cope with a pessimist’s outlook. The strategy to not let a person with glass-half-empty thinking get you down is to reduce the effect pessimism has on you, communicate effectively with those who have a less-positive outlook, and to educate yourself about pessimism.","Being around negative people can drain your energy and cause you to feel trapped and overwhelmed.

You might be dealing with an unscrupulous company or caller, but remaining polite is the best way to deal with it.","","Telemarketers are people with feelings who are just doing their jobs. It is the telemarketing companies who are really harassing you, not their employees. The best way to deal with these calls is to know your rights and fight the company, not the voice on the phone. Try to be a bit nicer to them when they call, even if they call during dinner.","","Norway is generally a very liberal country, and you will come a long way by just using common sense. Still, there are things that might be different from what you are accustomed to.

At its heart, being respectful means showing that you value other people's perspectives, time, and space.","Politeness is an important social skill that can help you make friends, succeed professionally, and show respect.  You may have good manners already but are looking to expand them for an upcoming dinner party, work event, or just for life in general.  You can be polite by offering a proper greeting and showing good manners with words and actions.","Table manners and etiquette rules change over time.

Make sure to always use common table manners and be appreciative and generous towards the host. If you are dining at a fancy restaurant, make sure to follow fine dining etiquette.","Bowing is a traditional way to show respect in many cultures.

You’re introduction should concisely address the following points: What your essay is about. What material you will cover in the essay. What your argument is.","A good economics essay requires a clear argument that is well-supported by appropriately referenced evidence. Research your topic thoroughly and then carefully plan out your essay. A good structure is essential, as is sticking closely to the main essay question. Be sure to proofread your essay and try to write in formal and precise prose.","","Craps is a game where many bettors get to stake their chips on a roll of the dice. The table layout makes the game seem a little confusing at first, but the rules are easy to pick up with experience. Before stepping up to a table, read about the kinds of bets available and how a round of craps play out. When you're ready to bet, practice proper etiquette to be a good player. Join in with enthusiasm as you cheer for everyone at the table to beat the house.","When writing an introduction paragraph, you should always include a hook to capture the reader's attention, supporting information about the topic at hand, and a thesis statement. That said, there are still multiple introduction paragraphs you can use for your paper. This article will describe a few common ones, as well as some that you might not have seen.","Books often have an introduction before the first chapter of the book. This text, which is essentially a short chapter, is meant to provide information on what the book is going to be about. It gives background information, talks about why the book is important and gives an overview of the contents.","","","","The introduction to your portfolio is a great way to tell your readers who you are and briefly explain what you'll be talking about. If you're using your portfolio to attract customers, it's important to give a few examples of professional accomplishments and make your introduction stand out by adding a couple of personal details. If you're writing an educational portfolio, summarize your main talking points and explain what makes you stand out. Don't forget to edit your introduction once you're finished so it looks professional!","In academic writing,  the ""CARS"" model proposed by John Swales is an efficient way to outline your research to the reader. Swales researched the structure of introductions found in academic articles and came up with a process of ""moves"" that result in a succinct, well-formatted and clear introduction. To follow this model,  establish the research territory by introducing the topic, saying why it is relevant, and outlining previous research on it. Next, establish your niche by making a counter-claim, showing a hole in pre-existing research, or added to ongoing research in the field. Finally, summarize your objectives, methodology, and the results of your research.","Writing can be an amazing hobby and a necessary skill. From realistic fiction to mysteries to sci-fi to poetry to academic papers, your writing is only limited by your imagination. Keep in mind that writing is a lot more than putting pen to paper: it takes reading, research, thinking, and revising. While not all writing methods work for everyone, there are some things all writers can do to boost their craft and create a comprehensive, engaging piece.","","A well-written introduction lets your reader know what you are going to be writing about. In it, you lay out the scope of your argument or discussion, whether you're writing an essay or a blog post. For a good introduction, begin by hooking the reader with an interesting opening. From there, you'll provide a few transition sentences to get to your main ideas, moving from a broad idea to a more specific one as you go.","1","1","4","4","1","1","4","1","4","4","1","0"

Spending too much time together can cause problems in a relationship. If you spend every waking moment with your partner, then you may not appreciate the time that you have together as much. Make sure to plan activities apart and retain your independence as you continue your relationship.

There are lots of ways that you can work together to keep the love in your relationship and keep it going for a long time. Start below to learn how.","It is human nature to crave space. It's not healthy to be the same person in any relationship, romantic or otherwise. While sharing experiences and feelings can bring many wonderful things to a relationship, you need time to be an individual as well. In order for a relationship to be healthy, you should have your own hobbies, interests, and social life. Work on establishing firm boundaries. From there, make the most of your alone time. Explore new hobbies and interests to get in touch with your own identity. If you need more space, there may be problems in your relationship. Look for ways to address and fix any underlying issues.","This wikiHow teaches you how to update the system software on your iPad using Software Update on the iPad or iTunes on your desktop.","Giving is extremely rewarding, and most of us really want to lend a helping hand. Lending a helping hand doesn’t have to mean giving money. Everyone can donate their time, compassion, or even patience to someone else. To get started on a giving journey, think about the different things you have to give (money, possessions, time, compassion), and focus on ways to make giving a habit. Then, jump into action by giving your time as a volunteer, donating goods or money, giving to friends and family, and furthering your giving mindset.","Your relationship with your partner may be one of the most important ones in your life, and if he asks for space, it can leave you feeling hurt and confused.  Sometimes, space is healthy and necessary for a relationship to function, and other times it’s important in indicating that it’s best to move on.  Though it may be hard, you can give a guy space through changing up your communication with him, developing your own interests, and then reconnecting when the time is right.","Whether you are writing an essay for school or a narrative report for work, you have to choose line spacing for any written work. Most people prefer to write with a double space between lines, because it makes it easier for the reader to follow the flow of the text. How you format your spacing depends on the word processing program you are using. Double space your work by setting up the right parameters for either an entire document or a selected amount of text.","Perhaps you are in a relationship with or dating a woman who you really like and enjoy spending time with.  In your mind, things might be going well, so if she asks for space, you might be feeling a bit perplexed.  Or perhaps things have been rocky for a while, so her need from space may arise from that.  Know that space can sometimes help bring couples even closer together, so work to give her space through communicating differently, enjoying your own life, and developing your relationship when the time is right.","Fewer than 600 people have been to space, and most of them have been professional astronauts. However, thanks to advances in technology, commercial space travel is seeming more and more likely every year. At this time, reserving a spot on a commercial spacecraft is incredibly expensive, but the costs may go down in the coming years as space travel becomes easier and more accessible.

It’s tempting to take this as a sign that he might be breaking up with you, but it’s not. In fact, his vulnerability and willingness to share his feelings gives you both the opportunity to make your relationship even stronger. Whether you’re giving him a bit more day-to-day space or taking a longer break, the key to improving your relationship is clear communication and honesty.","It is human nature to crave space. It's not healthy to be the same person in any relationship, romantic or otherwise. While sharing experiences and feelings can bring many wonderful things to a relationship, you need time to be an individual as well. In order for a relationship to be healthy, you should have your own hobbies, interests, and social life. Work on establishing firm boundaries. From there, make the most of your alone time. Explore new hobbies and interests to get in touch with your own identity. If you need more space, there may be problems in your relationship. Look for ways to address and fix any underlying issues.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good idea to arrive at least 10 minutes before your shift is scheduled to start. This way, you can ease into the workday and have a little time to prepare before going out on the sales floor. If you are habitually late you will be leaving your coworkers in a lurch. You also risk facing disciplinary action or even dismissal, depending on the jurisdiction in which you work. If you can't make work because you're ill or indisposed for a good reason, alert your workplace as early as you can. This allows them to make alternative arrangements to cover your shift.

Don't discuss your friend behind his or her back, and don't spread rumors about the confidences they've imparted to you. Never say anything about your friend that you would not be prepared to repeat to their face. Be loyal to your true friends and be prepared to defend them if your new friends, or people you barely know, start gossiping about them. Part of being loyal is understanding the importance of a long-lasting and stable friendship. Don't throw all that away just to spend all your time hanging out with your new boyfriend or girlfriend or a cool new person you just met. Remember that your friends might feel left out. If you have a reputation for being a blabbermouth or a gossip, then your friends will quickly find out and they'll be hesitant to reveal anything personal to you in the future -- or even to spend much time with you at all. Don't let others say bad things about your friend, either. Until you've had a chance to hear your friend's side of the story, treat comments that are not supportive as hearsay and rumors. If someone says something that shocks you and doesn't seem like a thing your friend would do or say, then respond with something like, ""I know them, and that doesn't sound right. Let me talk to them; find out his/her perspective on this. Until then, I would appreciate it if you didn't spread that around.""","Being a good friend isn't always easy, but taking the time to nurture a lasting friendship is worth every ounce of effort. Good friendships provide strength, happiness, and meaning in ways that social media or striving for popularity cannot. All true friendships are built on mutual trust and support, so whether you’re looking to make new, quality friendships or improve your existing ones, there are things you can do to be a good friend to others.","Being loyal to those around you can be a challenge, as it requires patience and generosity. Loyalty is the ability to put others before yourself and stick with them in good times and bad. Show loyalty to friends, family, and significant others by being honest, trustworthy, supportive, and generous. Maintain healthy boundaries with those around you so you can be loyal to them in a productive way.","","Writing a devotional is a great way to share the insights and experiences you've had throughout your Christian walk. When you write a devotional, focus on one short passage—often, just one verse. Then, engage the reader by connecting that verse to an anecdote or a personal interpretation of that verse, and finish with a call to action. Once you're comfortable writing one devotional, try compiling a collection of them to submit to a publisher!","","Keeping customers loyal should be at the top of every business owner's marketing plan. The amount of time, money and effort that goes into retaining customers is much lower than finding and obtaining new clients.","If you're a Christian, growing deeper in faith is a lifelong journey. For all Christians, worshiping publicly, such as by going to church or Bible study groups, is usually a big part of spiritual growth. In addition to public, community worship, being a faithful Christian involves private prayer and reflection. By engaging your community and praying on your own, you can strengthen your relationship with God and live a fulfilling, faithful Christian life.","Perhaps one of the most valuable assets you can have in a romantic relationship is loyalty. You may be struggling to find a partner who is loyal and reliable, especially when confronted with a difficult situation or a tricky relationship issue. Or you may already be with someone but are unsure if they are loyal and have what it takes to be your life partner. You can choose a partner who is loyal by looking at how they behave. You should also consider how you interact together as a couple and watch for any red flags that indicate the person is not as loyal as they could be.","Dogs make excellent pets, and are typically loyal and affectionate to their owners. These qualities may be especially important to families with young children, or for anyone looking for an emotionally calm and affectionate pet. If you’re looking to train and raise an especially loyal dog, you’ll need to start by considering the breed you want to buy or adopt—some dog breeds are genetically predisposed to be more loyal than others. From there, you should bring your dog home, and then raise it in a way that encourages trust and affection.","","","Being loyal to those around you can be a challenge, as it requires patience and generosity.

It does have nuances, however, and each of us has our own personal interpretations of where the lines begin and end. However, there are some pretty clear definitions, habits, and practices to remember when considering how loyalty works in a relationship.","1","2","4","2","3","3","2","2","4","3","1","4"

Even if you've been kissing for a while, you should still know how to kiss her in a variety of ways and make your kisses feel fresh. Don't overwhelm her and grope her the second you lock lips. Instead, take it slow, grazing your lips as you touch her hair or stroke her face. Take breaks from kissing so she has time to come up for air and want you even more. You are not very likely to have sex with your girlfriend if all you've done is kiss. It takes a bit longer for things to reach a natural progression.","You have reached that point in your relationship where you want to take it to the next level. Some people think that sex is no big deal, but others see it as something they only want to share with an extra-special person. Although you never want to force your girlfriend to have sex with you, you can always soothe some of her fears and reassure her that you really are a person she can fully trust. After you do this, sex comes naturally.","So you finally got ""the look"" and you're moving in for that killer kiss when it dawns on you that you need help—and fast.

Wall mirrors come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so it is important to carefully consider the area where you plan to hang them before making your purchase. In addition, because of the delicate nature of the glass and the need to adequately prepare the space where you will be hanging wall mirrors, you must be sure you have all the proper tools prior to beginning the task.","Well do you want your girlfriend to kiss you more often and you don't know how to do it? Do you want to make your kisses more interesting and funnier? Here is the answer!","Digital technology has opened up a variety of new ways to communicate- and even flirt- with others. Text messaging, which is sometimes called SMSing or simply texting, has quickly become a fun new way for people everywhere to flirt. Texting your flirt a kiss is simple, quick, and can be relatively non-committal way to show him how you feel.","The most important part of being kissable is being yourself and having the right partner. There are, however, definitely some things you can do to become even more kissable. Problems like bad breath, dry lips, and a lack of confidence can prevent you from kissing the person of your dreams. Luckily, those problems can be easily fixed or avoided. They can be avoided by maintaining good hygiene, taking care of your lips, and have a confident attitude so that you can be not only kissable, but nearly irresistible, to your partner.","If you’re seeing a friend for the first time in a while, or you want to hold back for your first kiss, a peck is the perfect way to go. Give a peck on the cheek, forehead, lips, or pretty much anywhere else you want! The main things to keep in mind are close your lips, make it light, and keep it short. Otherwise, you’re getting into full-on kiss territory.","Whether you're pursuing an acting career or just having fun performing in school plays, the time may come when you have to kiss a co-star on stage. It can be an uncomfortable situation, particularly if you've never done it before and you don't know the other person very well. The key to pulling off a believable kiss that you're both comfortable with is making sure you understand the tone of the moment and rehearsing it until it feels natural.","Blowing a kiss is a great way to show affection for someone in a lighthearted way.  Remember to lock eyes with the person while blowing them a kiss. Always choose an appropriate time to blow kisses and avoid making this gesture to anyone who might not like it.","","So you finally got ""the look"" and you're moving in for that killer kiss when it dawns on you that you need help—and fast.

Knowing how and when to initiate a kiss is probably the most intimidating part, but it's easier than you think! Start by flirting with him to show him how you feel. Then, when you're alone together, gradually move closer and wait for a lull in the conversation before making your move. Give him soft, sweet pecks and work your way up to French kissing when you're both ready.","4","3","1","0","3","4","3","4","0","2","2","2"

It will hurt a bit -- no doubt about it -- but it will hurt a lot less than a lifetime with a person who makes you feel terrible. Telling someone, ""We can hang out, but only if you're not negative"" would be like telling them you could only hang out if they were a different person. If it's not possible, come to terms with it. Cut them loose.","","All couples have arguments. However, there is a huge difference between sitting down and working through a problem as a team versus shouting, name-calling, and slamming doors. Aggressive arguments, however, aren’t the rule—other couples engage in silent treatments as a form of passive arguing. If you and your partner have toxic arguments, it could be tearing you apart. Eliminate these arguments by identifying and reducing toxic patterns, implementing healthy conflict resolution techniques, and strengthening your connection with one another.","","","Toxic relationships can feel like you're lugging a huge sack up a hill: the longer you try to do it, the heavier the burden becomes. Once you realize you're in a toxic relationship, take steps to relieve yourself of that burden by ending the relationship. Be upfront about what you want, so the person clearly understands that you want to end things. Set limits so you don't get pulled back in. Then, care for your emotional health and well-being so that you can have healthier relationships in the future.","A toxic relationship is one which drains your emotional and physical energy. It is characterized by constant negativity, criticism, and codependence. These relationships can be with anyone: your parents, family, partner, boss, work colleagues, or friends. You should learn to identify toxic relationships in your life. You do not want to remain in a relationship that is draining your energy and making you feel bad about yourself.","Ending a relationship is never easy. Though many people believe otherwise, ending a relationship can be just as emotionally exhausting as getting dumped. Before making a decision to end a relationship, you should always weigh the reasons for walking out. Once you are sure, though, it's important to remember that your soon-to-be ex was once your love. You should be honest without being cruel, and compassionate without giving the person hope. With a little tact and thoughtfulness, you can end the relationship and minimize the potential emotional damage. Be careful, it may hurt you too.","Toxic friends come in all shapes and sizes; what is the hardest thing about a toxic friendship is how it creeps up on you unawares. Although you may be laboring under incredible negativity and feeling awful around your friend, it can take a while to fully understand that this negativity is being caused by your friendship. Knowing the signs of a toxic friendship will help you to either avoid remaining in such a friendship, or perhaps even developing one in the first place.","","","Do you have a friend, family member, or romantic partner who is really difficult to get along with? Do you feel degraded or manipulated around them? If so, it's possible that you have toxic people in your life. Toxic people require a special kind of care to navigate, if you choose to continue to do so. There are techniques you can use to learn how to take care of yourself and deal with other people in a toxic relationship.","All couples have arguments.

Part of being peaceful is being at peace with yourself. Honesty is a vital component to being at peace with yourself. So, be honest, but kind, when communicating what you really think and feel. Having an open and honest dialogue in your relationships with others helps the relationship be more peaceful as well. It sets up a tone which communicates that if there are problems, they can be discussed and brought out into the open. You can state, “I want to you to be comfortable talking to me about anything.” Make sure you are communicating any frustrations or negative feelings in order to address them as quickly as possible. Try saying, “Our relationship is important to me. I don't want to bottle anything up and risk having it affect our relationship.” Have conversations just to check-in with loved ones. It will illustrate that you are interested in your loved ones well-being, and will make them more comfortable talking with you. You can begin with a simple, “How are you really doing?”","","No one likes lies. But, unfortunately, being dishonest with others and ourselves is sometimes easier than telling the truth. It doesn't need to be that way, though. Learning to be honest and eliminating the need for lies can help to clean up your conscience and your relationships. Shifting your perspective slightly and orienting yourself to a policy of honesty can help you to eliminate the need for lies and make it more attractive to tell the truth. See Step 1 for more information.","","Most people have lied about something at some point.  Most of the time these lies are small and insignificant, but sometimes you can tell a bigger lie that has some serious consequences.  Whether you started with a little fib that has spun out of control, or whether you told a whopper that you just can’t get out of, it can be a tricky thing to extricate yourself from the falsehood. Coming clean and trying to be a more honest person is a laudable impulse, but be prepared for what can be a rocky road to self-improvement.","Sincerity means being honest and straightforward without any pretense, misrepresentation, or deceit. Being a more sincere person can refer to how you interact with others, but ultimately sincerity must begin within yourself. Learning to recognize your thoughts and feelings can help you become a more genuine person, which in turn can help you become more sincere in your dealings with others.","Knowing how to get someone to tell you the truth is a useful skill to have. It can help you in a variety of situations, including at home and on the job. Although it can take some practice, patience, and confidence on your part, it is achievable and can help you get to the bottom of things. By showing a person you are on their side, starting the conversation in the proper way, and knowing the signs that someone is lying, you increase your chances of finding out the truth.","Getting to know new people can be really hard. That is what makes ice-breaker games so great! One of the most famous ""ice-breakers"" is the game ""two truths and a lie"" which involves guessing which of three ""facts"" about someone you don't know, isn't true. Here is wikiHow to play two truths, one lie.","No one likes lies. But, unfortunately, being dishonest with others and ourselves is sometimes easier than telling the truth. It doesn't need to be that way, though. Learning to be honest and eliminating the need for lies can help to clean up your conscience and your relationships. Shifting your perspective slightly and orienting yourself to a policy of honesty can help you to eliminate the need for lies and make it more attractive to tell the truth. See Step 1 for more information.","Whether you're telling a joke, telling a fairy tale, or trying to persuade someone with a little empirical evidence, telling a story well is an important skill. While it comes naturally to some, for others this skill is a learned one. Never fear, you can learn to tell a better, more engaging story with wikiHow as your guide! Just get started with Step 1 below.","Avoiding the truth is sometimes easier than admitting you’ve lied. Everyone has likely had those times when they are too scared to tell somebody face to face, or maybe there isn't a chance to talk in person. Writing a letter or sending a text message might not always be the best methods of confession. What if they have questions to ask you about what you've said? What if there is too much or it is too complicated to put into words? There are ways to prepare yourself for admitting the truth to someone over a phone call.","Have you ever had that niggling feeling in the back of your mind, telling you that you're not being truthful with yourself? Maybe your deceiving yourself into believing your career or relationship is great, when it's not. Or maybe you beat yourself up over your finances, when you're actually doing a great job. Either way, being honest with yourself is a great opportunity to build life skills, rise above challenges, gain self-acceptance, and improve authenticity.","","Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the truth. Telling a hard truth can mean many different things, from that awkward moment when you let a friend know their zipper’s undone, to telling a romantic partner that you’re having issues with the relationship. Be it significant other, friend, coworker, or family member, telling someone the truth is generally the right decision. It leads to open and honest communication about how to move forward in a constructive way. Though it may seem scary, using kind language, exhibiting empathy, and being open minded will help you get through a hard conversation with grace.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4"

Though it may seem that this person is hard to find, you will sometimes learn that love is just around the corner, especially if you seek it actively and constructively.  You can find your unconditional love if you look for good partners, develop a happy relationship, and work on building deep love with that person.","Sometimes it seems easier to love others than it does to love yourself, but self-acceptance is an important part of developing healthy relationships with others.

This does not mean to rely 100% on these instructions.

Your first love teaches you what it's like to be in a romantic relationship. Experiencing anything for the first time sets the tone for how you will engage in such experiences in the future. If you're struggling to get over your first love, this is perfectly normal. This is something most people struggle with, but there are things you can do to help yourself move on. First, limit thoughts of your ex. Try to focus on the present and not dwell on the past. Try to adopt a healthier perspective about the relationship. While it ended, you learned a lot about yourself by being in love. After grieving, try to move forward. Focus on what's ahead of you rather than your lost love.","Sometimes life can get you down and you may be really hard on yourself. No matter what your are facing in your life, it is important to continue to love yourself. You can learn to love yourself by using strategies to become more compassionate towards yourself, let go of things that bother you about yourself, and develop a sincere love and appreciation for yourself.","Am I pretty or handsome enough, smart enough, brave enough, or even likable?

You should feel ready to date again after having time to think, grieve, grow, and move on. If you are in the middle of an ugly divorce settlement, it may be best to wait until the logistics of your divorce are finalized. If you’re thinking about your ex and what they are up to, you’re probably not ready to date yet. EXPERT TIP																															Klare Heston, LCSW																Clinical Social Worker								Klare Heston is a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker in Ohio. She received her Master of Social Work from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1983. Klare Heston, LCSW			Clinical Social Worker				Take time to reconnect with yourself before you jump back into dating. Ideally, your first goal should be to relax and re-stabilize your life following a divorce. You owe it to yourself to get to know yourself and your likes, needs, and wants. Some people lose touch with themselves following a bad relationship.","Years may have gone by since you last dated, so how do you jump back in? It’s important that you are fully ready to move on from your divorce before dating, both logistically and emotionally. Put yourself out there by being open to date invitations and don’t shy away from using technology to find potential partners. Once you're out on a date, show the person that you're interested by flirting and having fun. If the date goes well and you click with the person, ask them on a second date to further explore their potential.","","In general, people who keep themselves busy are happier than people who do not. However, it’s easy to fall into the trap of keeping yourself mindlessly busy with menial tasks. While there’s a time and place for completing day-to-day tasks, you’ll be much happier if you keep yourself busy with activities and pursuits that are meaningful to you.","The way in which you begin a divorce will depend on your relationship with your spouse and the laws of the state in which you live. Some states allow for legal separation, while others view a marriage as legally valid until a court rules otherwise. In some cases, you may choose to petition the court for divorce without an attorney, while in others legal representation is important to a successful outcome. Spouses may also choose mediated divorce or collaborative divorce in order to minimize conflict and reduce attorney fees.","","Considering divorce is never easy. Nevertheless, you must confront the fact that your marriage is no longer healthy. Once you decide to leave, you face a choice: to divorce or to separate. To choose between the two, you should consider the financial consequences of divorce. You should also seek the help of a divorce attorney, who can offer expert advice about what is your best option.","If you're in an abusive marriage, you need to leave. Such situations are highly dangerous and you need to get out. Divorcing an abuser can be a complicated legal process. Make preparation ahead of time, seek qualified legal counsel, and ask for support from friends and family members.","Maybe you've been unhappy in your marriage for years. Or maybe for the last two or three years, you've been thinking about divorce. Perhaps the only thing holding your marriage together is guilt over splitting up your family. But after a lot of thought (and perhaps counseling) you've decided it's time to tell your husband you want a divorce. Though it will be a difficult conversation to have, it's possible to have a discussion with him that is effective and clear.","If you have reservations about what you need to do to protect yourself in the event that you are preparing to marry a divorced man, know that there are questions that you can ask your potential mate and steps that you can take to protect yourself as well as children from another relationship or relationships. You want to make sure that you are okay with dating someone who is divorced, that you build a relationship with the people in his immediate family, and that your potential life partner is ready to commit to you as a boyfriend before anything else.","Divorce is one of the most emotionally draining and overwhelming experiences a person can endure, but you can overcome it and emerge stronger and happier than before. To cope with your divorce, you'll need to give yourself time to heal, work on enjoying your single life, and seek support from others. Processing and recovering from divorce takes a lot of time and energy, but you'll feel more stable and centered once you're able to let go of your failed relationship and learn to love your life again. If you want to cope with your divorce and rediscover your strength and happiness, start by following these steps.","Deciding you want a divorce is a difficult conclusion to come to, and then telling your spouse can be even more difficult. Because this is such an important discussion, it’s important to make thorough considerations prior to the discussion with your spouse. Then, when you are ready, you can be prepared to talk to your spouse in a civil, respectful way.","Marriage is a dynamic bond between two people that requires attention and care.  Initial passions and feelings can fade over time if they aren't cultivated, especially in the face of stress caused by financial issues, professional demands, or raising a child.  If your marriage is in a difficult time, don't lose hope.  There are many ways to help remind each other why you fell in love to begin with.","","3","3","2","3","2","2","4","2","2","2","2","4"
