Have a draft on hand and be ready to tailor it to the specifics of each job. A good cover letter should explain your experience and qualifications. You should use specific examples to describe why you would be a good fit for the job you’re applying for. Maybe a job description calls for someone who can work as part of a team. You could write about how, as an intern, you were in charge of organizing a project that multiple interns worked on.

The process may seem daunting, but going in with determination and a plan will carry you through until you find the perfect opportunity.","Cover letters. As much as they require more work, cover letters are a great opportunity to cover qualifications we can’t fully explain in our resumes. In addition, they help personalize job applicants to enable them to come across more as real people to potential employers. If you throw together a cover letter in the hopes that nobody will actually read it, you might be missing a chance to land the job. To take advantage of a cover letter's full potential, follow these steps below. You’ll find advice on formatting, reviewing, and researching cover letters. You will also find links to three free samples, which you can copy and adapt to your own personal cover letter.","The key to a strong teaching cover letter is expressing your passion for the job you are applying for while still managing to sound professional.

Here are some guidelines for writing a management cover letter.","Need to write a polished, professional letter? Most business letters follow an established, easy-to-learn format that you can adapt to any type of content. A business letter should always contain the date, information about the sender and recipient, and a few body paragraphs. Follow these steps and modify them as necessary to fit your company's standards.","Application letters are typically written to accompany school or job applications. The purpose of the letter is to introduce yourself to the decision committee, and to outline your qualifications in a specific way. It can be the only time other than an interview that you have a chance to really stand out in an application, so it's important to get it right. You can learn what to include in your letter, how to style it, and how to format it to give yourself the best chance.","In tough economic times, you'll find more competition for jobs, and your cover letter is important if you want to land those jobs. Regardless of the economic picture, hotel jobs and other jobs in the hospitality industry are a constant.

Most girls aren't attracted to people who are constantly putting themselves down. So be confident, but not cocky. Know what you are good at. Don't brag about it or show off, but put these things into your routine and don't be afraid to let them shine every once in a while. The difference between real confidence and cockiness is in how you think about yourself. True self-confidence means you know who you are, and you’re comfortable and happy with that. Cockiness often stems from a need to compete with or put down others to make yourself feel confident. Truly confident guys and girls don’t need to belittle anyone or be a jerk to show that they know they’re cool. If you do feel the need to take a jab at yourself, make sure you present it as a joke. Laugh at the mistakes you make and the stupid things you do, as well as the things you don't like about yourself. ""Seriously, you DO NOT want me to ask you to dance. I'm a terrible dancer. Danger to myself and others. It's best for everyone.""","Who doesn’t want to fall in love? It’s an almost universal desire, as common as a hashtag on a Kardashian tweet. If you are interested in a girl and desperately want her to love you back, there are some ways to inspire her interest. Getting a girl to fall in love with you requires you to build attraction with verbal and nonverbal interaction, while also showing her your naturally lovable qualities and taking the time to get to know her. Most importantly, be yourself and respect her for who she is.","Confidence is a very tricky little thing. Feeling good about yourself is so easy to put at the will of others when it should only be up to you. The good news is that you're driving this self-assurance train and it's ready to depart from the station.","","Self-confidence comes from within. It can be found in people who are happy with themselves and accept their flaws. A self-confident person is not afraid of being judged or looked at and is someone who feels powerful in all situations. It does not matter what you look like, how big your feet are, or how long your hair is. Every person of every shape and size can gain self-confidence. Here are some guidelines.","","Fierce confidence goes beyond just believing in yourself. It’s the type of confidence that other people take notice of and want to emulate. With the right attitude and a commitment to improvement, you, too, can have the fierce confidence required to attract the hottest dates, land your dream job, and be enviable.","Confidence is a very tricky little thing. Feeling good about yourself is so easy to put at the will of others when it should only be up to you. The good news is that you're driving this self-assurance train and it's ready to depart from the station.","Exuding confidence can help you in your personal life, relationships, and the work place. To exude confidence, work on your body language, speaking style, and overall attitude. Make sure to stand tall, use an even voice, and make eye contact while talking. Work on feeling confident overall. Remember not to be afraid of other people's judgment, and embrace who you are as a person.","Walking with confidence is a great way to create a great first impression or simply demonstrate your confidence to the world without saying a word. It's easy to fall into bad habits like slouching and looking down when you are in an uncomfortable situation, but these habits can make you seem nervous or scared. If you want to work on your walk in order to appear more confident, there are some simple strategies that you can use. Keep reading to learn how to walk confidently!","","","Trust is a fundamental factor in creating and maintaining meaningful relationships. Trusting in someone can mean everything from telling a person your deepest secrets to knowing they'll be on time for an appointment. There are many levels of trust, but all require you to put your faith in someone.","2","0","2","1","2","1","3","3","4","1","1"

Try to center this protest around an upcoming legislation or a physical event, like the demolition of an art gallery. Protesting in a public place helps to generate interest for your cause. Make sure to be respectful throughout a public protest. Many successful protests have created change through their peacefulness.","The arts allow people to publicly express themselves in fun, creative, and meaningful ways. Art, music, and theatre all provide countless creators, musicians, and entertainers with a livelihood. Without public support and proper funding, though, these mediums may begin fading from local communities. You can help support the arts by providing financial assistance, attending community functions, and petitioning officials from your school and government.","When you just can't stay silent on a particular issue, expressing your views through civil protest is a positive way to make a difference. Gathering with other people to collectively speak out against wrongdoing is a fundamental right and a powerful way to bring about change. See Step 1 and beyond to learn how to organize and execute a safe and peaceful protest.","Sometimes conditions at your school are bad enough that it's making your ability to learn suffer. It may be time to flex those democratic muscles and have a good old-fashioned protest. Knowing your rights in these situations is incredibly important as you seek the support of the student body and other faculty members. Use petitions, sit-ins, and walk-outs to aid your cause in swaying the school's policy makers. During protests, it's important to keep pressure on the administration while working to avoid conflict and keeping protester morale going.","Protests are a great way to bring attention to a cause while expressing your discontent, but your message might be lost if violence, rioting, or vandalism occurs. If you are organizing the march, work ahead of time to identify safe and legal avenues to protest. Participants should use unaggressive tactics to gain visibility without confrontation. This can be done by working with both the police and legal aid to  ensure that nobody violates the law or individual rights.","The U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission enforces federal law that prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. These laws cover federal government employees, private sector employees, and job applicants, although the complaint procedure for each group is slightly different.","Individuals are affected by natural disasters every day. In some circumstances, the President of the United States will declare your area a federal disaster zone, which triggers the availability of federal disaster assistance. Disaster assistance comes in many forms and can help support home rebuilding efforts, employment efforts, medical efforts, and legal efforts. If you and your household have been affected by a flood, earthquake, fire, or other natural disaster, you should apply for disaster assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the federal agency responsible for handling most basic applications for assistance. Visit their website and start the application process as soon as possible to receive the assistance you need.","Breastfeeding in public might seem like a challenge at first, but it will become second nature with a little practice. Set yourself up for success by knowing your rights and preparing to breastfeed. Select a quiet spot and take a support person with you when you're starting out. Once you've gained confidence, learn tricks to make breastfeeding in public more comfortable. Remember to keep a positive attitude and enjoy the chance to feed your baby.","When you just can't stay silent on a particular issue, expressing your views through civil protest is a positive way to make a difference.

Swim. Run. Lift. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps relieve stress and you'll find that the more you get out and exercise, the easier work and school will seem. Exercising is commonly known to reduce stress. Scientists have shown that regular participation in aerobic exercise leads to decreased stress, elevated and stabilized moods, improved sleeping habits, and increased self-esteem.","As an adult, you have obligations. You’ve got a job. You pay bills. You may even have a family — a spouse and/or children. You need to work, but you’d also like to go back to school and achieve something greater.

We've laid out the steps you should take to get yourself onto the path that leads to the fitter, healthier you.","","It is important to remain healthy and active throughout life, especially as you age. Staying fit can add years to your lifespan and will markedly improve your overall well-being. There are so many diet gurus and exercise regimens out there that staying fit can seem like a daunting task, but it is really quite simple if you stick to the basics. As a general rule, it takes about two months for a behavior to become a habit. Try making a few changes that you think you will be able to manage, and then stick to them for a couple of months until they become part of your natural routine.","It is often difficult to exercise after work if you are tired from the long day and lunchtimes are usually too small of a window to fit in a workout. A great way to fit in some exercise is to do it before work. Exercising in the early morning can give you an energetic boost and lift your mood before the day begins; it certainly clears out the sleepy cobwebs! Some people are able to jump right into doing morning workouts with little to no adjustment period. Others need more time to ease into a new routine. With enough persistence, you can learn to fit workouts into your pre-work routine.","If you are using an older version of Internet Explorer, browsing modern websites can be really difficult. Every time you encounter a website that uses Adobe Flash or some other type of Internet application, you have to manually activate Active X (something that controls Internet applications on Internet Explorer), otherwise you won't be able to really use the website at all.
