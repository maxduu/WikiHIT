For babies and children under five years of age, taking a rectal temperature is most accurate. For older children and adults, taking an oral temperature is perfectly fine. As an alternative for people of any age, you may take an axillary (armpit) temperature, but this method is not as accurate as the others and should not be relied upon if you're worried the person has a fever.","Stretching correctly will increase your flexibility and reduce your risk of injuries when exercising or going about your daily life.

A fever raises the body's internal temperature to create an inhospitable environment for the bug, which usually dies off within a matter of days. Generally, any temperature over 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) is considered a fever. This article will help self-identify a fever as well as give you advice about how to follow should the fever present a more serious medical situation.","","A fever is a short-term increase in your body temperature over your normal baseline of around 98.6°F (37°C). You usually get a fever when you're sick, because fevers are your body's self-defense mechanism against germs – your fever is trying to kill whatever is causing your illness! Thus, fevers themselves don't need to be treated as an illness, and they aren't dangerous for adults unless they get too high.

If you have a fever, or are caring for someone who has a fever, this article provides information and advice about how you can diagnose and, if necessary, treat the fever.","If you are ill and/or have any fevers, please treat them with the following instructions below.","There are many fun and fascinating ways to measure temperature. Whether you’re interested in the temperature of the air, your body, or other objects, there are several different types of thermometers that can help get the measurement you need. Just make sure that you are using the right tools and techniques for the type of measurement that you want.","A fever is not an illness in itself, but is usually a sign that the body is working to fight off an illness of some kind.

Soon, you’ll have new friends who love you for who you are. Go to LGBTQ+ events or Meetups in your area. Set a goal to meet people and say, “Hi.” Over time, you’ll make a few new friends.","Coming out to your friends can be scary, but it’s also a really exciting time in your life. Revealing your sexuality or gender identity allows you to live the life you want, but it’s normal to feel worried about how people are going to react. To make coming out to your friends easier, first decide who you feel comfortable telling. Then, plan what you want to say beforehand. Once you know what you want to say, announce your sexuality or gender identity in a way that’s comfortable for you. Additionally, be prepared to handle different types of reactions.","Meeting new people and making friends can be overwhelming, but with a little effort and willingness to step outside of your comfort zone, you can easily make friends.

Here are some ways to become knowledgeable about the legal system and options available to LGBT people.","For some people, coming to terms with your sexuality  is easy; one look at your feelings and attractions and you know. But for some – most, in fact – it’s a long emotional battle where you have to experiment with identification and relationships before knowing and then face all sorts of bullying. Some never make it to the end due to their bullying experiences, and have ended up killing themselves because they can’t come to terms with it. Sexuality can rule people’s lives if it isn’t understood and accepted early on.

Alternatively, stick to the either/or rule. You can either wear a necklace or a bracelet, for example. Wearing too many accessories easily becomes overkill. They distract from each other, too.

This article will teach you how to find the right foundation for your skin and how to apply this popular beauty product.","Foundation is a type of cosmetic that’s used to cover discolorations and imperfections, minimize the appearance of pores, smooth out the skin’s texture, conceal blemishes, and provide a base for other cosmetics. Foundation is supposed to go on your skin to cover and conceal, but the makeup itself shouldn’t be noticeable or apparent. For foundation to look natural and even, you must apply it using the proper technique, but you also have to use the right foundation shade and type for your skin.","Applying foundation and powder together sounds simple enough. It can leave you with a smooth finish, but only if done right. If done wrong, your skin might look too shiny or too dry.

Be sure to choose the perfect shade, take your time to apply it the right way, then set your foundation for a flawless look.","Powder foundation is lighter on the skin, absorbs quickly, and can come with less mess. If you're in a hurry in the morning, powder foundation can be a great choice for you. Make sure to apply the foundation correctly. You can use either a brush or a sponge. Using a solid primer and proper application can prevent your makeup from fading throughout the day.","","Establishing a private foundation can be a rewarding and socially beneficial venture, particularly if you are more interested in advancing broad causes than providing direct services. The IRS identifies several factors which distinguish a private foundation from a public charity, but the basic dichotomy is simple enough:  A private foundation generally funds other nonprofits, and a public charity provides direct services. Since private foundations are tax exempt, the IRS has a stringent process to determine whether an organization qualifies. In addition, anyone interested in starting a Private foundation will have to do extensive pre-planning and filing paperwork and registering in the states in which they operate.","1","0","1","1","2","1","2","2","1","3","1","4"

DNS is a server that translates websites' addresses so that your browser can connect to them. If the addresses become out-of-date or the server has issues, you'll encounter a DNS error and won't be able to connect to a specific site or group of sites even with Internet access. You can potentially fix DNS issues by troubleshooting your current connection, flushing the DNS cache, disabling extra connections, changing your computer's default DNS server, and even resetting your router. Open DNS is a fairly good solution!,  some personally use 64.94.1.1 and 4.2.2.4 as primary and secondary DNS servers. Very rarely, you must search google, or any other browser, for the domain-name and select that. While using OpenDNS, it is much more common for that. Head to adapter settings, under network, and click internet, travel to network, and lastly choose sharing whilst selecting ""change adapter settings"".  Select your connection (usually quite easy to identify), and then ""properties"".  You'll select ""Internet Protocol Version 4""  and choose ""properties"". There, you can find it. Ideally, you might need to change your router's DNS, but this works only for a particular PC. To find your own DNS servers and also to benchmark/ diagnose your current DNS service, try heading over to Gibson Research (grc.com) and try checking out their DNS utilities, which are extremely informative!","You can display the contents of your Domain Name System (""DNS"") cache by using the Command Prompt app on PCs or the Terminal app on Macs.

Websites that tend to be blocked at work consist mainly of the popular social media and entertainment websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. However, you can easily bypass these IP restrictions to view all of your favorite websites at work by using a Smart DNS Proxy Server.

DNS is a server that translates websites' addresses so that your browser can connect to them. If the addresses become out-of-date or the server has issues, you'll encounter a DNS error and won't be able to connect to a specific site or group of sites even with Internet access. You can potentially fix DNS issues by troubleshooting your current connection, flushing the DNS cache, disabling extra connections, changing your computer's default DNS server, and even resetting your router. Open DNS is a fairly good solution!,  some personally use 64.94.1.1 and 4.2.2.4 as primary and secondary DNS servers. Very rarely, you must search google, or any other browser, for the domain-name and select that. While using OpenDNS, it is much more common for that. Head to adapter settings, under network, and click internet, travel to network, and lastly choose sharing whilst selecting ""change adapter settings"".  Select your connection (usually quite easy to identify), and then ""properties"".  You'll select ""Internet Protocol Version 4""  and choose ""properties"". There, you can find it. Ideally, you might need to change your router's DNS, but this works only for a particular PC. To find your own DNS servers and also to benchmark/ diagnose your current DNS service, try heading over to Gibson Research (grc.com) and try checking out their DNS utilities, which are extremely informative!","You can display the contents of your Domain Name System (""DNS"") cache by using the Command Prompt app on PCs or the Terminal app on Macs. It can then be flushed through a series of commands, or by an Airplane Mode reset on mobile. DNS caches are responsible for cataloging the sites you visit, but a DNS error can prevent you from being able to view these sites. Displaying and flushing the cache will help fix these errors.","","This wikiHow teaches you how to clear your computer's DNS cache, which is a collection of recently visited websites' addresses.

Hold the clutch down and shift to first gear by pushing the shifter down with your left foot. Your bike will start to move on its own without activating the throttle as you slowly release the clutch. Practice keeping your balance as it moves forward at a slow speed. Keep your hand on the brake in case you start losing control. Practice on an isolated section of road or in a parking lot that has little traffic so you don’t have to worry about other motorists. If you let go of the clutch too fast, you may kill the engine. If this happens, shift back into neutral and start your engine again. Practice “power walking” by walking it forward while slowly releasing the clutch to accelerate. Work your way up until you’re comfortable keeping your feet on the pegs while your bike is moving.","Motorcycles are fun vehicles that allow you to experience the open road. However, it's critical that you learn to ride in a controlled and safe way. Take a motorcycle safety course and get a permit or license if it is required in your region. Before you start to ride, purchase safety gear and get to know how your bike handles. With a little time and practice, you’ll be ready to cruise around on your bike!","One of the most important processes of riding a motorcycle is shifting gears.

Unlike traditional freewheel bikes, fixed gear bike pedals continuously move while the bike is in motion. Other than the technical differences, fixed gear bikes are also typically lighter and easier to repair than freewheel or mountain bikes. If you want to ride a fixed gear, you need to learn how to stop, wear a helmet, and practice in a safe area before you take it out on the road.","Road biking is a great hobby and an even better workout.

If you spend all of your time nitpicking your spouse about minor problems that don't really matter, then they're not going to listen to you when major issues come up. Criticism can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes are clean and unbroken, for instance, don't nag your spouse about how to load the dishwasher ""the right way."" Let them do things their own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Avoid criticizing your spouse without doing it constructively. Remember to try to be calm and rational, as strong emotions can easily turn a discussion into an argument. If you criticize every little thing they do, then they will quickly tune you out. You should praise your spouse for the things they do right much more than you argue with them about things that they do wrong.

Though backing away from a fight is usually your best option, if you have to fight, then you need to know how to defend yourself and how to attack your opponent at the right time. Whether you're fighting on the street or fighting in a controlled environment, knowing how to assume the correct stance and to target your opponent's weakest areas can save your life. If you want to know how to fight, just follow these steps.","A custody battle is not ideal. Instead, it would be better if you and the other parent could reach an agreement on child custody and spare everyone the emotional stress of a custody dispute. However, agreement isn’t always possible. If not, then you need to prepare for a custody battle. Understand what factors a judge considers when deciding custody and gather evidence that helps your case. Custody battles don’t always involve parents. For example, grandparents might be fighting to get custody. However, the process is generally the same.","","Bloons TD battles is the multiplayer version of Bloons TD.
