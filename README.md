# WikiHIT
NETS213 Final Project

→ (1) Collect Harry’s (Li Zhang) model data \\
  → (1a) User interface website for users to test out and obtain outputs from the model (4 pt)
  → (1b) Build/deploy/manage AMT HITs asking if a step is relevant to a given article (2.5 pt) 
      → Implement quality control (quality control module, gold-standard: 1 layer down on tree w/ BFS,            direct hyperlinks on the WikiHow page) (2pt)
→ (2) Collect accuracy data (aggregation module) (2pt)
    → (2a) Data visualization (on how model is accurate across categories, how deep down the tree each          node/article is, word similarity vs accuracy) (3.5pt)
    → (2b) Loop back to possibly variants of AMT HITs to collect more data as necessary, continuously study how the model can be improved (3pt)
    → (2c) show Harry, possibly ask for more data given what we find (1pt)
